# SemanticPy

A collection of projects in python looking at semantics. Mostly orientated around search.

## Example

```python
from semanticpy.vector_space import VectorSpace

vector_space = VectorSpace(["The cat in the hat disabled", "A cat is a fine pet ponies.", "Dogs and cats make good pets.","I haven't got a hat."]))

#Search for cat
print vector_space.search(["cat"])

#Show score for relatedness against document 0
print vector_space.related(0) 
```
