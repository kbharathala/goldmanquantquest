(May 2010) Five businessmen founded 3M in Two Harbors, Minnesota, in 1902. The company moved to St.&#160;Paul, where it remained for 52 years before outgrowing the campus and moving to its current headquarters at 3M Centre in Maplewood, Minnesota. The new Maplewood campus is 475 acres (1.92&#160;km2) and has over 50 buildings, including an Innovation Center that displays products 3M has taken to market. The company began by mining stone from quarries for use in grinding wheels. Struggling with quality and marketing of its products, management supported its workers to innovate and develop new products, which became its core business. Twelve years after its inception, 3M developed its first exclusive product: Three-M-ite cloth. Other innovations in this era included masking tape, waterproof sandpaper, and Scotch brand tapes. By 1929, 3M had made its first moves toward international expansion by forming Durex to conduct business in Europe. The same year, the company’s stock was first traded over the counter and in 1946 listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The company is currently a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and of the S&amp;P 500. Founding This section needs additional citations for verification.

(May 2009) The building in which the company was founded is now a museum The founders original plan was to sell the mineral corundum to manufacturers in the East for making grinding wheels. After selling one load, on June 13, 1902, the five went to the Two Harbors office of company secretary John Dwan, which was on the shore of Lake Superior and is now part of the 3M National Museum, and signed papers making Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing a corporation. In reality, however, Dwan and his associates were not selling what they thought; they were really selling the worthless mineral anorthosite. The company's late innovations include waterproof sandpaper (1921) and masking tape (1925), as well as cellophane ""Scotch Tape"" and sound-deadening materials for cars. In 1947, 3M began producing PFOA by electrochemical fluorination. During the 1950s, the company expanded worldwide with operations in Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom in large part by Clarence Sampair. In 1951, DuPont started purchasing PFOA from then-Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (DuPont called PFOA C8) for use in the manufacturing of teflon, a product that brought DuPont a $billion a year profits by the 1990s. In 1951, international sales were approximately $20 million. 3M’s achievements were recognized by the American Institute of Management naming the company “one of the five best-managed companies in the United States"" and included it among the top 12 growth stocks (3M). In the late 1960s and early 1970s, 3M published a line of board games, largely under the ""3M bookshelf game series"" brand. These games were marketed to adults and sold through department stores, with easily learned simple rules but complex game play and depth and with uniformly high-quality components. As such, they are the ancestors of the German ""Eurogames"". The games covered a variety of topics, from business and sports simulations to word and abstract strategy games. They were a major publisher at the time for influential U.S. designers Sid Sackson and Alex Randolph. In the mid-1970s, the game line was taken over by Avalon Hill. 3M traffic signals installed in Shelton, Washington. Standing off-axis from the intended viewing area, these signals are invisible to adjacent lanes of traffic in daylight. (A faint glow is visible at night) The same two signals above, taken in the signal's intended viewing area (a single lane of northbound traffic). Special light-diffusing optics and a colored fresnel lens create the indication. 3M's Mincom division introduced several models of magnetic tape recorders for instrumentation use and for studio sound recording. An example of the latter is the model M79 recorder, which still has a following today. 3M Mincom was also involved in designing and manufacturing video production equipment for the television and video post-production industries in the 1970s and 1980s, with such items as character generators and several different models of video switchers, from models of audio and video routers to video mixers for studio production work. 3M Mincom was involved in some of the first digital audio recordings of the late 1970s to see commercial release when a prototype machine was brought to the Sound 80 studios in Minneapolis. After drawing on the experience of that prototype recorder, 3M later introduced in 1979 a commercially available digital audio recording system called the ""3M Digital Audio Mastering System"", which consisted of a 32-track digital audio tape recorder and a companion 4-track digital recorder for mixdown &amp; final mastering. 3M later designed and manufactured several other commercially available models of digital audio recorders used throughout the early to mid-1980s. In 1980, the company introduced Post-it notes. In 1996, the company's data storage and imaging divisions were spun off as the Imation Corporation. Imation has since sold its imaging and photographic film businesses to concentrate on storage. Today, 3M is one of the 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (added on August 9, 1976), and is 97 on the 2011 Fortune 500 list. In December 2011, 3M completed the acquisition of the Winterthur Technology Group, a bonded abrasives company. 3M follows a business model based on ""the ability to not only develop unique products, but also to manufacture them efficiently and consistently around the world (3M)"". In 1999 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began investigating perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) after receiving data on the global distribution and toxicity of PFOS. including Integrity Supply.

Abbott In 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace C. Abbott (1857–1921), an 1885 graduate of the University of Michigan, founded the Abbott Alkaloidal Company. At the time, he was a practicing physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was the use of the active part of a medicinal plant, generally an alkaloid (morphine, quinine, strychnine and codeine), which he formed into tiny ""dosimetric granules"". This approach was successful since it produced more consistent and effective dosages for patients. Abbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907, and the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada (Fact 21). In June 2014 the company entered into a definitive agreement to take over Russian pharmaceutical manufacturer Veropharm (Voronezh) in a deal worth $631 million. Abbott, which already employs 1,400 people in Russia, said it planned to set up a manufacturing presence in the country when the deal closed. Diabetes Care: Glucose monitoring devices Diagnostics: Hematology, immunodiagnostic, oncology and clinical chemistry (including the i-Stat) Established Pharmaceutical Products: Branded generic drugs sold exclusively in developing markets. Molecular: analysis of DNA, RNA, and proteins at the molecular level Nutrition: baby nutrition (Similac, Isomil, and Gain), adult health products (Ensure and ZonePerfect) and special dietary needs (Glucerna) Vascular: stents, vessel closure devices, endovascular and coronary technologies Vision Care: intraocular lenses for cataracts; laser-vision correction technologies; corneal care products The company has divested itself of less profitable businesses through sales and spinoffs. In 1964, it acquired Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott. In 2001, the company acquired Knoll, the pharmaceutical division of BASF. In 2002, it divested the Selsun Blue brand to Chattem. Later in 2002, the company sold Clear Eyes and Murine to Prestige Brands. In February 2010, Abbott completed its $6.2 billion (EUR 4.5 billion) acquisition of the pharmaceuticals unit of Solvay S.A.. On May 16, 2014, it was announced that Abbott would acquire the holding company (Kalo Pharma Internacional S.L. which owns 73% of Chilean pharmaceutical company, CFR Pharmaceuticals) for $2.9 billion.

Abbott has also been recognized for 11 consecutive years for sustainability leadership through its inclusion on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). In March 2003, British company Cambridge Antibody Technology (CAT) stated its wish to ""initiate discussions regarding the applicability of the royalty offset provisions for Humira"" (Adalimumab) with Abbott Laboratories in the High Court of London. In December 2004, the judgment ruled for CAT. Abbott was required to pay CAT US$255 million, some of which was to be passed to its partners in development. Of this sum, the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom) (MRC) received US$191M, and in addition, Abbott was asked to pay the MRC a further US$7.5M over five years from 2006, providing that Humira remains on the market."

Arthur Andersen increased its use of accounting services as a springboard to sign up clients for Andersen Consulting's more lucrative business. Throughout the 1990s, there was increasing tension between Andersen Consulting and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting was upset that it was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a condition of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit – whether AA or AC – paid the other this sum), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting claimed breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2&#160;billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture. Accenture's banner hanging on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) building for its initial public offering on July 19, 2001. On 19 July 2001, Accenture offered initial public offering (IPO) at the price of $14.50 per share in New York Stock Exchange (NYSE); Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley served as its lead underwriters. Accenture stock closed the day at $15.17, with the day's high at $15.25. On the first day of the IPO, Accenture raised nearly $1.7&#160;billion. In October 2002, the Congressional General Accounting Office (GAO) identified Accenture as one of four publicly traded federal contractors that were incorporated in a tax haven country. The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a US-based company; it stated that ""prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity."" Accenture engaged in a very large and ambitious IT overhaul project for the National Health Service (NHS) in 2003, making headlines when it withdrew from the contract in 2006 over disputes related to delays and cost overruns.

Gursahaney (Chief Executive Officer) Alan Ferber (President, Residential Business Unit) Luis Orbegoso (President, Small Business Business Unit) Shawn Lucht (President, Customer Experience &amp; Service Delivery) Arthur Orduña (President, Innovation &amp; Product Development) Revenue US$ 3.4 billion (FY 2014)  Net income US$ 304 million (FY 2014)  Total assets US$ 10.5 billion (FY 2014)  There were many small telegraph delivery companies in the United States in the 19th century. In 1874, 57 district telegraph delivery companies affiliated and became ""American District Telegraph"". With the increase in telephone usage in the late 19th century, ADT's messenger business slowly declined in popularity. ADT tried branching out and developing their signaling business, while still maintaining their telegraph business as primary income source. ADT incorporated into Western Union in 1901 and separated its messenger business from its main signaling business at that time. In 1909, Western Union and ADT came under the control of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T). ADT began to expand into new areas, such as fire alarms and security alarms between 1910 and 1930, but was kept separate from AT&amp;T's Holmes alarm business. ADT became a publicly owned company in the 1960s. In 1964, ADT was found to be a monopoly in restraint of trade. It was shown to provide almost 80% of the central station alarm service in the United States. In some cities, such as New York City and Memphis, Tennessee, they were the sole provider. They were also found to have forced competitors out of business by lowering prices below cost. They would charge national accounts very low prices in cities with competitors and much higher prices where no competition was available. ADT was forced to adopt a national price list, which could not be varied, to help establish central station competitors in cities without competition, and to pay fines and triple damages to the federal government, customers, and local competitors. On October 1, 2012, ADT debuted as an independent public company and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:&#160;ADT). Acquisition of Broadview Security In early 2010, Tyco International announced that it was acquiring Brink's Home Security Holdings, (operating as Broadview Security) and was merging the company with its ADT brand name in a transaction valued at $2.0 billion. The transaction, which was finalized and closed mid-2010, combined the #1 and #2 security companies in North America, adding Broadview's 1.3 million customer accounts and $565 million in annual recurring revenue to ADT's existing customer base of 7.4 million accounts and $3 billion in annual revenue.

Ellsworth, who later became the first U. S. Patent Commissioner, served as Aetna's president for two years until 1821, when he resigned, but Ellsworth continued as a director for another 16 years. Ellsworth's brother, William Wolcott Ellsworth, also served as a director, as well as the company's first General Counsel. 1908 Aetna hired its first home office female employee (Julia Kinghorn, telephone switchboard operator), the first of what has become more than two-thirds of Aetna’s employees. 1970 Aetna's Pension, Casualty and Life Division under the direction of B.E. Burton, President and Lead Actuary, saw billion-dollar growth in the post-ERISA pension administration segment that placed Aetna in the top 5 global pension and investment asset management and recordkeeping firms in the world, with over $11.8 billion (US) in new sales and assets under management during the decade. 1990s 2000 Aetna sold its financial services and international businesses to ING for $7.7 billion, spun off its health business to its shareholders, thus focusing its business as an independent health and group benefits company. 2001 Aetna recruited global public relations and marketing executive Roy Clason, Jr. to lead the companies reputation management strategies during Aetna's multi-year corporate turnaround campaign. 2006 John Rowe ended his 65 months as CEO and executive chairman of Aetna; during his tenure, the former Harvard geriatrician earned $225,000 a day (including Sundays and holidays). 2007 Aetna chief medical officer Troy Brennan told the Aetna Investor Conference that, ""The (U.

And in many circumstances people initially diagnosed with cancer are waiting over a month, which is intolerable. "" Through June 30, Aetna took in $14 billion in premiums: $10.7 billion of that amount from employers and employees, $2.9 billion more from Medicare recipients who bought a supplemental insurance plan to cover the gaps in what Medicare covers, and another $400 million for handling Medicaid claims.

Healthcare), its Pennsylvania subsidiary, and one of its former senior executives, Richard Wolfson. In its suit, BCI accused Aetna U. S. Healthcare of tortious interference with contractual relations. BCI alleged the managed-care company used its economic power in the business of prescription drug sales to coerce one of BCI's clients, the ""I Got It at Gary's"" pharmacy chain, into using another Aetna U. S. Healthcare subsidiary, Corporate Health Administrators, as its health benefits management firm. According to the suit, Aetna U. S. Healthcare threatened to drop ""I Got it at Gary's"" from its pharmacy network if the company didn't switch to Corporate Health Administrators. Aetna and the American Dental Association (ADA) announced a class-action settlement by dentists who accused Aetna of interfering with dental procedures to cut costs and forcing dentists to comply with excessive paperwork.

In 1964, the company name was changed to American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. The company, in 1990, adopted the Aflac initials, although the official name of the underwriting subsidiary remains American Family Life Assurance Company of Columbus. Aflac announced the appointment of Frederick J. Crawford as Chief Financial Officer, as well as Executive Vice President in June 2015. Consumer groups and some government officials say that cancer insurance returns fewer premium dollars to policyholders than standard insurance. A U.S. General Accounting Office study found that the policies paid back as little as 35% of premiums (Aflac said its cancer insurance paid back 62.4%). In comparison, New York State requires most major-medical policies to pay back 82% and group policies to pay back 75%. New York State does not allow stand-alone cancer policies. In 1997, AFLAC spent $175,000 on lobbyists and campaign contributions to change the law. Celebrities have starred in the Aflac ads, including Chevy Chase (2003); Yogi Berra; Yao Ming; Donald Trump's wife, Melania Trump; NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Carl Edwards (2008–); the United States Olympic synchronized swimming team (2004); and Wayne Newton playing at Stardust Hotel and Casino for the 2003 commercial.

It serves the communities of Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, Suffolk, Hampton, Newport News, Williamsburg, and Hanover Counties. The company continues to be one of the fastest-growing natural gas distribution companies in the country. Additional services include: Operating a 150-mile (240&#160;km) high-pressure intrastate pipeline originating in Quantico and terminating in Williamsburg, Virginia Operating two propane storage and vaporization facilities and a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facility located in James City County and Chesapeake to supplement natural gas supplies as needed Formerly the natural gas operations of Dominion Virginia Power, VNG was sold to Consolidated Natural Gas in 1990. Jefferson Island Storage &amp; Hub (JISH) is a salt dome natural gas facility and is located near Erath, Louisiana (Vermillion and Iberia parishes). At JISH, two underground salt caverns are used to store gas before it is put into pipelines and sent to residential and commercial customers. These caverns have a total capacity of 9.4 billion cubic feet and connect to the Henry Hub via the Sabine pipeline. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) AGL Resources owns and operates four LNG peak-shaving facilities, which supply gas at peak use times. The largest, the Riverdale LNG plant in Riverdale, Georgia, has storage capacity of 31,080,000 gallons or 2,560,000 million cubic feet (Mcf) of natural gas in its two tanks. Located south of Atlanta, the plant is supplied by two interstate pipelines for supply. It is connected to the Atlanta Gas Light beltline pipeline system for distribution of gas to the Atlanta market. The plant is able to deliver 400,000 Mcf/day of gas during peak send-out. The Cherokee LNG plant, located north of Atlanta in Ball Ground, Georgia, has storage capacity of 25,242,957 gallons or 2,020,237 Mcf equivalent of natural gas in a single tank. The 934-acre (3.78&#160;km2) site was designed to accommodate a second tank of equal capacity if warranted. This plant receives supply from three pipelines and can deliver an equivalent of 400,000 Mcf/day of peak send-out to AGL's Atlanta market. AGL Resources also owns and operates an LNG plant in Macon, Georgia. This plant's single tank storage capacity is 18,900,000 gallons or the equivalent of 1,501,983 Mcf. Although the plant is capable of delivering up to 150,000 Mcf/day, the pipeline system exiting the plant can accommodate a delivery of less than half that volume, of only 70,000 Mcf/day. In Tennessee, Chattanooga Gas, another AGL Resources subsidiary, receives peak day supplies from the company’s Chattanooga plant, which holds the equivalent of 1,186,035 Mcf. This facility is supplied by two pipelines and can deliver up to 90,000 Mcf/day to the Chattanooga Gas market. AGL Resources, through Virginia Natural Gas (VNG), also owns some storage capacity — 752,174 Mcf equivalent — in the Columbia Natural Gas Company-operated Chesapeake LNG facility. This plant is located at the end of the Columbia pipeline that supplies VNG’s south system. To more fully utilize this contracted capacity, VNG constructed an LNG vaporization plant adjacent to its propane plant in 2002.

(Netli), On Nov. 2, 2015, Akamai acquired Bloxx, a provider of Secure Web Gateway (SWG) technology, One of Akamai's patents covers a method of delivering electronic data using a “content delivery network,” or “CDN.” Internet Web site proprietors (content providers) contract with Akamai to deliver their Web sites’ content to individual Internet users. The patented method permits large files, such as video or music files, to be stored on Akamai’s servers and accessed from those servers by Internet users. This increases the speed with which Internet users access the content from Web sites. Unfortunately for Akamai, its patent was written in a way that called for or permitted actions by multiple persons or entities—such as the content provider customer and the company providing the CDN service. Akamai's competitor Limelight chose to operate its allegedly infringing service in that manner—it performed most steps of the patented process and its customers performed a so-called tagging step. Under the interpretation of patent law at the time when Akamai decided to sue Limelight for patent infringement, a method patent could be held infringed only when a single actor performed all of the steps. The court therefore overturned a $40 million jury verdict in Akamai's favor. Akamai lost the case, even taking it to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court returned the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, however, with an invitation to re-evaluate its rule, if it chose to do so, that all the steps of a method had to be performed by a single actor for there to be infringement. On remand, the Federal Circuit considered the matter en banc (all active judges of the circuit) and modified its rule. It now held that a patent could also be directly infringed if ""an alleged infringer conditions participation in an activity or receipt of a benefit upon performance of a step or steps of a patented method and establishes the manner or timing of that performance."" On that basis, the Federal Circuit reinstated the $40 million jury verdict. It said that ""Akamai presented substantial evidence demonstrating that Limelight conditions its customers' use of its content delivery network upon its customers' performance of"" the steps that Limelight does not itself perform. This has been considered a substantial change in patent law. For further discussion of the case, see the Wikipedia article Akamai Techs., Inc. v. Limelight Networks, Inc."

(from Aluminum Company of America) is an American public company best known for its work with lightweight metals and advanced manufacturing techniques. The world's third largest producer of aluminum, behind Chinalco and Rusal, As of 2014, the company has $37.4 billion in assets and 59000 employees. Its operations are made up of three business groups: Engineered Products and Solutions (EPS); Global Rolled Products (GRP); and Global Primary Products (GPP). EPS consists of five businesses: aerospace, gas turbines, building and construction, and commercial transportation. EPS mainly concerns the manufacturing operations, such as production of airfoils, fasteners and architectural systems. The GRP segment possesses two units: Global Packaging (producing beverage containers, industrial packing and foil); and Aerospace, Transportation and Industrial, which manufactures aluminum plates and sheets for these markets. The GPP manages the commodity segment, wherein the mining, refining, smelting and energy operations are run. The company's largest business unit, GRP, generated 31% of its revenue in 2014, while the EPS business made up 25%. The primary metals unit, or GPP, accounted for 28% of revenue, while the production of alumina contributed the remainder. As of 2016, Alcoa will be split into two publicly traded entities, an aluminum commodity business and a higher-value manufacturing operations company. The former will keep the Alcoa name, while the latter's name is Arconic. While the aluminum company will possess five business units including bauxite and aluminum, the second entity's portfolio will comprise EPS, GRP and Transportation and Construction Solutions (TCS). The split is to be finalised by mid 2016. The ""new Alcoa"" consists of 64 facilities, a staff of roughly 17000 and a yearly revenue of $13.2 billion for 2014. The second company spans 157 sites and employs about 43000 workers, having a comparative revenue of $14.5 billion. As of 2007, the company has undergone a divestment from primary aluminum, focusing on higher-profit value added metal products, such as aluminum sheets and titanium castings instead. Since that year, Alcoa has closed or sold 1.3 million tons of its smelting capacity (and will continue to do so), according to the Wall Street Journal. The change in strategy has produced a favourable turnaround, with the company seeing its best operating results since 2008, with a net profit of $368 million in 2014. In 1886, Charles Martin Hall, a graduate of Oberlin College, discovered the process of smelting aluminum affordably, almost simultaneously with Paul Héroult in France. He realized that by passing an electric current through a bath of cryolite and aluminum oxide, the then semi-rare metal aluminum remained as a byproduct. This discovery, now called the Hall-Héroult process, is still the only process used to make aluminum (however, see also Bayer process). By 1902 New Kensington consisted of 173,000 sq. feet on 15 acres with 276 employees and the company operated hydropower and reduction plants in Niagara Falls, NY (1895), Shawinigan Falls, Quebec (1900), mining operations in Bauxite, AR (1901) and reduction facilities in East St. Louis, IL (1902). ""The Aluminum Company of America"" became the firm's new name on January 1, 1907. The acronym ""Alcoa"" was coined in 1910, given as a name to two of the locales where major corporate facilities were located (although one of these has since been changed), and in 1999 was adopted as the official corporate name. Aluminum nodules produced by Charles Martin Hall in 1886, using the electrolytic process, Exhibit in the Senator John Heinz History Center. The company's expansion of operations to the Dutch and British Guianas during the early years of the twentieth century established the company as the ""dominant actor"" in the bauxite industry throughout the interwar period, being in control of the best deposits in the region. Alcoa operating in the British Empire's soil had to concede to an agreement with the British government, which consisted of accepting that bauxite from ""public properties already leased"" was to be placed at the government's disposal. An alumina refinery was built in Canada during the early 1930s to accommodate to these demands, wherein in case of an emergency the government would be able to seize the aluminum it needed. During the Second World War, this policy proved useful for the war effort, and some output from Alcan smelters was used. From 1902 until 1915 additional plants in Massena, New York (1903); Alcoa, Tennessee (1911); Edgewater, New Jersey (1915); and Badin, North Carolina (1915) came online while New Kensington had 31 buildings in the complex housing six departments (tubes, sheets, rods, bar and wire, extrusion, jobbing, foil) and two subsidiaries (Aluminum Cooking Utensil Company and Aluminum Seal Company). In 1907 it created the ""company town"" of Pine Grove, New York, for workers outside Massena. In Badin, Alcoa, Maryville and elsewhere the company funded the construction of schools, parks, playgrounds and medical facilities. Alcoa purchased an 8% stake of Aluminium Corporation of China (Chalco) in 2001. Alcan tried to take over Alcoa instead. BHP Billiton subsequently announced its bid to acquire Rio Tinto, after which Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) did as well. Rio Tinto reacted by bidding for Alcan, after which BHP and CVRD considered taking over Rio Tinto. In October, however, Rio Tinto's Alcan friendly takeover deal closed, wherein its $38.1 billion bid turned out to be 40% higher than Alcoa's original offer, the biggest in Canadian history. Alcoa thus withdrew its bid. On January 9, 2014, Alcoa reached a settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice over charges of bribing Bahraini officials. Under the terms of the settlement they will pay the SEC $175 million to settle the charges. To settle the criminal claims with the DOJ, Alcoa World Alumina (AWA, a company within Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals) is pleading guilty to one count of violating the anti-bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). In June 2010, Alcoa launched construction of its newest aluminum production facility as a joint venture with the Saudi Arabian Mining Company. The project includes a bauxite mine, a refinery, a smelter and a rolling mill. The new operations in Saudi Arabia have considerably lower costs (particularly energy, which is required in large amounts for the Héroult process) than those in Tennessee, Australia and Spain. In March 2015, Alcoa announced a review of 14% of its global smelting capacity and 16% of its global refining capacity (about 500 thousand and 2.8 million tons respectively), cutting back its substantial global smelting operations, particularly in Brazil and Australia as part of that process. The company made acquisitions increasing its focus on aerospace products. In February 1999, Alcoa cleaned soils and sediment contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and lead at the York Oil federal Superfund site in Moira, New York, in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency. The site, a former waste oil recycling storage facility, accepted waste oil from a number of companies, including Alcoa. The facility was improperly managed and operated and, as a result, soils on the York Oil Property and nearby wetlands sediments and groundwater were contaminated. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a Superfund Unilateral Order on December 31, 1998, requiring Alcoa to excavate, treat and dispose of the contaminated wetland sediments. The Political Economy Research Institute ranks Alcoa 15th among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (13 million pounds in 2005) and toxicity of the emissions. Its operations are made up of three business groups: Engineered Products and Solutions (EPS); Global Rolled Products (GRP); and Global Primary Products (GPP). This last segment also manages Alcoa's power facilities, generating about a fifth of its worldwide smelters' energy requirements. Alcoa owns and operates the majority of its alumina refineries through its 60% share of Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC). AWAC produces alumina from three refineries: Kwinana (Australia), Point Comfort (US) and San Ciprian (Spain). As of September 2015, Alcoa's legacy commodity business was split from its specialised manufacturing arm, creating a new corporate entity. When the break-up finalises, the aluminum company will possess five business units, including bauxite and aluminum; the second entity's portfolio consists of EPS, GRP and Transportation and Construction Solutions (TCS). Expansion of the operation in 2007 resulted in Alcoa owning a total of 55% of the operation. In October 2014, the company announced the sale of its portion the operations with Noble Group in Jamaica, citing high energy costs as their main reason for doing so. Under a compensated service agreement, Alcoa (through AWAC) will continue to manage Jamalco for 3 years. Alcoa's Micromill technology (used in the 2016 Ford F-150) is notable for manufacturing a coil of aluminum alloy in 20 minutes, as opposed to 20 days by using conventional manufacturing processes, while reducing a plant's size by 75%. An experimental micromill was set up in San Antonio, Texas to test the technology with Ford. The latter has exclusive North American rights for an undisclosed number of years. In October 2014, Alcoa opened the world's largest aluminum-lithium plant in Lafayette, Indiana, which creates alloys for the aerospace industry. If forms part of Alcoa's three aluminum-lithium expansions (the others being the Alcoa Technical Center in Pittsburgh and the Kitts Green facility in the UK), at a cost of $90 million. Alcoa is currently the premier supplier of said alloy, and makes components for the Airbus A380, A350, Boeing 787 and Gulfstream G650. In Guinea, Alcoa operates through Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinée (CBG), a consortium of aluminum companies including Alcan and Dadco, the other half of which is owned by the Guinean government. This consortium is known as Halco Mining. In 2006, Alcoa extracted 86300 tons of bauxite daily, used for consumer brands production, such as Reynolds wrap. Guinea has the largest bauxite deposits in the planet. In 2006, Alcoa and the government of Iceland signed an agreement on instigating a thorough feasibility study for a new 250,000 tpy (Tons Per Year) smelter in Bakki by Húsavík in Northern Iceland. In October 2011, the proposed project was dropped because ""the power availability and proposed pricing would not support an aluminum smelter"". Alcoa first began commercial operations in Russia and opened an office in Moscow in 1993. Initially having tried, under Paul O'Neill, to purchase a Siberian smelter, the company refrained from doing so. It returned in 2005, under Alain Belda, to acquire two of the largest fabricating plants, both about 500 miles (800&#160;km) from the capital. As of 2008, the Company employs approximately 7880 people at its manufacturing operations in Samara and Belaya Kalitva. Chinese operations are extensive, encompassing practically all of Alcoa's operating segments, including aerospace manufacturing, wheels and other engineered items production, logistics and trading. Prominently, Alcoa operates a fastening-systems facility in Suzhou (opened in 2006), and is an important supplier of aluminum products to Chinese aircraft manufacturers for their Boeing subcontracts, such as the Xian Aircraft Corporation Boeing 737 vertical-tail assemblies. Alcoa operates two bauxite mines in Western Australia—the Huntly and Willowdale mines. Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals owns and operates three alumina refineries in Western Australia: Kwinana, Pinjarra, and Wagerup. The Wagerup expansion plans (increasing its refining capacity to 4.7 million tonnes a year) have been put on hold due to the Global Financial Crisis, and as of September 2015 these plans are still on hold.

Alexion_Pharmaceuticals," Alexion Pharmaceuticals Type Public Traded&#160;as NASDAQ:&#160;ALXN NASDAQ-100 component S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Pharmaceutical Founded 1992 Founder Leonard Bell Headquarters New Haven, Connecticut, U.S. Key people Max E. Link (Chairman) David L. Hallal(CEO) Products Soliris Revenue US$ 1151.346 million (2013) 37% Operating income US$ 528.010 mil (2013)31% Net income US$ 252.895 mil (2013) Total assets US$ 3.317696 bil (2013)27% Total equity US$ 2.382079 bil (2013)21% Number of employees 1774 (December 2013) Website www.alxn.com Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc. is an American pharmaceutical company best known for its development of Soliris, a drug used to treat the rare disorders atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). In 2000, Alexion moved its headquarters from New Haven to Cheshire, Connecticut. Alexion is expected to move back to New Haven following the completion of New Haven's Downtown Crossing project in December 2015 - Alexion's new headquarters are to be located at 100 College Street Since 2006, Alexion has been a supporter of Healthcare Research and Quality studies at Duke University for aspirin and Clopidogrel (trade name Plavix). Alexion received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for Soliris in 2007. It was initially approved to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disorder. In 2010, there was an outbreak of hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) in Germany. Soliris was considered as a treatment option due to its effectiveness in treating Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, an illness similar to the one caused by the EHEC infection. As a result, Alexion's German subsidiary provided an unspecified number of Soliris doses at no charge to physicians who requested it. Alexion is thus seeking a stronger position in the lucrative rare disease market, and is willing to pay a premium to obtain that position. The rare disease market is seen as desirable because insurers have minimal motive to deny claims (due to small population sizes of patients) and are unable to negotiate better drug prices due to lack of competition. The following is an illustration of the company's mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs and historical predecessors: Alexion Pharmaceuticals Alexion Pharmaceuticals (Founded 1992) Proliferon Inc (Acq 2000, restructured into Alexion Antibody Technologies Inc) Enobia Pharma Corp (Acq 2011) Synageva BioPharma (Acq 2015) Products Main article: Eculizumab Alexion's first drug, Soliris, used to treat the rare disorders atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) and Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). On September 23, 2011, the FDA officially approved the use of Soliris as a treatment for atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome in both adults and children. More than half of people with aHUS end up dying of it as a result of damage to vital organs/organ failure (usually involving the kidneys) caused by uncontrolled complement activation. The FDA's decision to grant approval received a positive response from the medical community with the director of Pediatric Nephrology at Atlanta's Children's hospital calling it ""the most important advance that has been made for patients and families with this disease"". It costs £340,200 (approximately €430,000) per year for ongoing treatment in the UK and US$409,500 a year in the United States (2010). On May 4, 2013, De Standaard reported that a press relations (PR) agency working for Alexion had helped the boy's parents communicate their story to the press. In 2013, 36% Alexion's sales originated in the US, down from 37% the previous year; 33% came from Europe, down from 35%; Japan accounted for just over 10%. Revenue was impacted by higher unit volumes for Soliris (up 40%), and a decreased average price related to rebates in Europe. Acquisition related costs fell significantly from $22 million to just $5 million. ^ a b c d e f g ""Alexion Pharmaceuticals 2013 Annual Report"" (PDF).

Allstate Corporation Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;ALL S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Insurance Founded April&#160;17, 1931; 84 years ago&#160;(1931-04-17) Headquarters Northfield Township, Illinois, U.S. Key people Thomas J.

The company also has personal lines insurance operations in Canada. Allstate was founded in 1931 as part of Sears, Roebuck and Co., and was spun off in 1993. The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years. The company’s ""You're in Good Hands with Allstate"" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers. (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.) In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969. In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign ""Mayhem"" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”. In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent.

Decreased enterprise-wide carbon footprint (direct and indirect emissions) by 9% in recent years 24% relative to 2007 baseline as disclosed in the 2012 Carbon Disclosure Project report. Decreased energy use in Allstate-owned facilities by 5% in 2011 and 4.75% relative to 2007 baseline. In 2011, Allstate replaced bottled water service with water filtration filling stations. This initiative eliminated the consumption of approximately 637,310 bottles in 2011. Expanded recycling program and introduced a Secure Paper Disposal Program across the company. The program recycled over 5 million pounds of paper. Reduced company wide use of office paper by 11.4% from 2010 levels, which includes a 40% reduction at the corporate headquarters and 4% reduction in regional field offices. Reduced customer-focused paper in 2011 by 22% since 2012 through electronic policy, billing and payment options. This reduced consumption by approximately 24 million pieces of paper in 2011. The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its ""good hands"" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out ""boxing gloves.""  Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called ""Colossus"" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release."

(renamed from Philip Morris Companies Inc. on January 27, 2003) is one of the world's largest tobacco and cigarette corporations. It is a multinational corporation based in Henrico County, Virginia, United States. Altria is the parent company of Philip Morris USA, John Middleton, Inc., U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company, Inc., Philip Morris Capital Corporation, and Chateau Ste. Michelle Wine Estates. Philip Morris International was spun off in 2008. Altria maintains a 28.7% stake in the UK-based brewer SABMiller plc. It is a component of the S&amp;P 500 and was a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average until February 19, 2008. On January 6, 2009, Altria acquired UST Inc., a smokeless tobacco manufacturer, which also owned wine producer Ste Michelle Wine Estates, and is now a subsidiary of Altria.

(December 2009) Altria emerged from Philip Morris. The onset of ""rebranding"" of Philip Morris Companies to Altria took place in 2003 (Philip Morris would later split, with PM USA remaining Altria's primary and only consistently held asset). Altria was created because Philip Morris wished to emphasize that its business portfolio had come to consist of more than Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International; at the time, it owned an 84% stake in Kraft, The name ""Altria"" is claimed to come from the Latin word for ""high"" and was part of a trend of companies rebranding to names that previously did not exist, Accenture (previously Andersen Consulting) and Verizon being notable examples, In 2003 Altria was ranked Fortune number 11, and has steadily declined since. In 2010 Altria Group (MO) ranked at Fortune number 137, whereas its former asset, Philip Morris International, was ranked 94th. On March 30, 2007, Altria's 88.1% stake in Kraft Foods Inc was spun off, through a distribution of the remaining stake of shares (88.1%) to Altria shareholders. That same year, Altria began selling all its shares of Philip Morris International to Altria stockholders, a spin off that was completed on March 28, 2008. Again in 2007 the company began the acquisition of cigar manufacturer John Middleton Co. from Bradford Holdings, Inc., which was complete in 2008. After Philip Morris International spun off, the former international subsidiaries halted the purchase of tobacco from America, which was a major factor in the closing of a newly renovated plant in North Carolina, an approximately 50% reduction in manufacturing, large-scale layoffs, and induced early retirements. In 2008, Altria officially moved its headquarters from New York City to to Richmond, Virginia after Philip Morris sold its downtown offices in New York City a decade earlier. With a few exceptions, all manufacturing, commercial, and executive employees had long been based in and around Richmond. Currently the company is headquartered in an unincorporated area within Henrico County, less than five miles west of the city limits of Richmond and less than ten miles from its downtown Richmond campus. Aside from the Philip Morris/Altria headquarters, some of their other buildings included the Philip Morris Center for Research and Technology in downtown Richmond, their manufacturing center in South Richmond, and the adjacent operations center which began shutting down in 2007-2008, as a result of the loss of demand from PMI member companies. The layoffs beginning in 2007 affected thousands of Altria, Altria Client Services, Philip Morris USA, and contracted employees in Richmond and North Carolina. In 2009, Altria finalized its purchase of UST Inc., whose products included smokeless tobacco (made by U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company) and wine (made by Ste. Michelle Wine Estates). Altria Group, Inc. owns 100 percent of Philip Morris USA, John Middleton, Inc. and Philip Morris Capital Corporation. It also owns 28.7% SABMiller PLC, one of the world's largest brewing companies, where it has 3 seats on the 11-person board of directors. Before the recent restructuring, the net revenue (and operating income) of Altria Group, Inc. came predominantly from its tobacco business, as is shown in the following table. Altria's share of SABMiller's revenue and profits is not included in the table below because its holding are too small to be consolidated in the group accounts.

(/ˈæməzɒn/ or /ˈæməzən/), often referred to as simply Amazon, is an American electronic commerce and cloud computing company with headquarters in Seattle, Washington. It is the largest Internet-based retailer in the United States. Amazon.com started as an online bookstore, later diversifying to sell DVDs, Blu-rays, CDs, video downloads/streaming, MP3 downloads/streaming, audiobook downloads/streaming, software, video games, electronics, apparel, furniture, food, toys and jewelry. The company also produces consumer electronics—notably, Amazon Kindle e-book readers, Fire tablets, Fire TV and Fire Phone—and is the world's largest provider of cloud infrastructure services (IaaS). The company began as an online bookstore, an idea spurred off with discussion with John Ingram of Ingram Book (now called Ingram Content Group), along with Keyur Patel who still holds a stake in Amazon. While the largest brick and mortar bookstores and mail order catalogs might offer 200,000 titles, an online bookstore could ""carry"" several times more, since it would have a practically unlimited virtual (not actual) warehouse: those of the actual product makers/suppliers. Amazon was incorporated in 1994, in the state of Washington. In July 1995, the company began service and sold its first book on Amazon.com: Douglas Hofstadter's Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies: Computer Models of the Fundamental Mechanisms of Thought. In 1996, it was reincorporated in Delaware. Amazon issued its initial public offering of stock on May 15, 1997, trading under the NASDAQ stock exchange symbol AMZN, at a price of US$18.00 per share ($1.50 after three stock splits in the late 1990s). Amazon's initial business plan was unusual; it did not expect to make a profit for four to five years. This ""slow"" growth caused stockholders to complain about the company not reaching profitability fast enough to justify investing in, or to even survive in the long-term. When the dot-com bubble burst at the start of the 21st century, destroying many e-companies in the process, Amazon survived, and grew on past the bubble burst to become a huge player in online sales. It finally turned its first profit in the fourth quarter of 2001: $5 million (i.e., 1¢ per share), on revenues of more than $1 billion. This profit margin, though extremely modest, proved to skeptics that Bezos' unconventional business model could succeed.

The company launched amazon.com Auctions, a web auctions service, in March 1999. However, it failed to chip away at the large market share of the industry pioneer, eBay. Later, the company launched a fixed-price marketplace business, zShops, in September 1999, and the now defunct partnership with Sotheby's, called Sothebys.amazon.com, in November. Auctions and zShops evolved into Amazon Marketplace, a service launched in November 2000 that let customers sell used books, CDs, DVDs, and other products alongside new items. As of October 2014, Amazon Marketplace is the largest of its kind, followed by similar marketplaces from Sears, Rakuten and Newegg. In August 2007, Amazon announced AmazonFresh, a grocery service offering perishable and nonperishable foods. Customers could have orders delivered to their homes at dawn or during a specified daytime window. Delivery was initially restricted to residents of Mercer Island, Washington, and was later expanded to several ZIP codes in Seattle proper. It is part of Quidsi, the company that Amazon bought in 2010 that also runs the sites Diapers.com (baby), Wag.com (pets), and YoYo.com (toys). Amazon's Subscribe &amp; Save program offers a discounted price on an item (usually sold in bulk), free shipping on every Subscribe &amp; Save shipment, and automatic shipment of the item every one, two, three, or six months. In July 2014, Amazon said it would invest $2 billion (Rs 12,000 crore) in India to expand business, after its largest Indian rival Flipkart announced $1 billion in funding. In 2005, Amazon announced the creation of Amazon Prime, a membership offering free two-day shipping within the contiguous United States on all eligible purchases for a flat annual fee of $79 (equivalent to $96 in 2016), Amazon launched the program in Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom in 2007; in France (as ""Amazon Premium"") in 2008, in Italy in 2011, and in Canada in 2013. In April 2015, Amazon started a trial partnership with Audi and DHL in order to get deliveries directly into the trunks of Audi cars. This project is only available on the Munich (Germany) area to some Audi connected car users. an over-the-top subscription service that enables Amazon Prime subscribers to add additional streaming video services to their accounts. Among the programming providers involved in the program are Showtime, Starz (with additional content from sister network Encore), Lifetime Movie Club (containing recent original movie titles from Lifetime Television and Lifetime Movie Network), Smithsonian Earth, and Qello Concerts. In January 2016, Amazon Prime reached 54 million members according to a report from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. In September 2011, Amazon announced its entry into the tablet computer market by introducing the Kindle Fire, which runs a customized version of the operating system Android. The low pricing of Fire ($199 USD) (In addition to copyright law, Amazon's terms of use agreements restrict use of the MP3s, but Amazon does not use digital rights management (DRM) to enforce those terms.) and, in December 2008, Amazon MP3 was made available in the UK. At the launch of Amazon MP3 in the UK, over 3 million Digital Rights Management (DRM)-free songs were made available to consumers, with prices that started at 59p, compared to Apple's 79p starting price. An Amazon.com exclusive is a product, usually a DVD, that is available exclusively on Amazon.com. Some DVDs are produced by the owner of the film or product, while others are produced by Amazon.com itself. The DVDs produced by Amazon are made using its ""CreateSpace"" program, in which DVDs are created, upon ordering, using DVD-R technology. The DVDs are then shipped about two days later. Some DVDs (such as the Jersey Shore Season 1 or The Unusuals Season 1) are released first as an Amazon.com exclusive for a limited time before being released elsewhere. On May 23, 2011, Amazon.com allowed customers to download Lady Gaga's Born This Way album for 99 cents, resulting in some downloads being delayed, due to an extremely high volume of downloads. AWS Summit 2013 event in NYC. Main article: Amazon Web Services Amazon launched Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2002, which provides programmatic access to latent features on its website. In November 2005, Amazon began testing Amazon Mechanical Turk, an application programming interface (API) allowing programs to dispatch tasks to human processors. In March 2006, Amazon launched an online storage service called Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). An unlimited number of data objects, from 1&#160;byte to 5&#160;terabytes in size, can be stored in S3 and distributed via HTTP or BitTorrent. The service charges monthly fees for data stored and transferred. In 2006, Amazon introduced Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS), a distributed queue messaging service, and product wikis (later folded into Amapedia) and discussion forums for certain products using guidelines that follow standard message board conventions. Also in 2006, Amazon introduced Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a virtual site farm, allowing users to use the Amazon infrastructure to run applications ranging from running simulations to web hosting. In 2008, Amazon improved the service by adding Elastic Block Store (EBS), offering persistent storage for Amazon EC2 instances and Elastic IP addresses, and offering static IP addresses designed for dynamic cloud computing. Amazon introduced SimpleDB, a database system, allowing users of its other infrastructure to utilize a high-reliability, high-performance database system. In 2008, Amazon graduated EC2 from beta to ""Generally Available"" and added support for the Microsoft Windows platform. Amazon continues to refine and add services to AWS, adding such services as Scalable DNS service (Amazon Route 53), payment handling, and AWS specific APIs for its Mechanical Turk service.

Prior to the formation of Ameren, the first major development in the history of its constituent parts occurred in 1929, when the Bagnell Dam was completed on the Osage River and generated almost 175 megawatts of hydroelectricity for Missouri's Union Electric Company. The dam also created the Lake of the Ozarks with 1,400 miles (2,300&#160;km) of shoreline. In 1931, Union Electric Light and Power sought additional generating sources (interurbans being one need) and the company began buying power from the Keokuk, IA dam, 150 miles (240&#160;km) north of St. Louis. Union Electric later bought the dam, providing 134 megawatts of hydroelectricity carried over a longer distance than had ever been achieved before. By the 1950s Union Electric owned gas operations in and around Alton, Illinois, and acquired other utilities to become the third largest distributor of natural gas in Missouri. In 2004, Ameren acquired (from Dynegy Inc.) its third partner from the 1952 Midwest Power Pool system, Illinois Power Company. In a merger completed February 1, 2000, Illinova Corp. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dynegy Inc. (NYSE:&#160;DYN), in which Chevron Corporation also took a 28% stake. Dynegy in turn had been created in June 1998, from the merger of Chevron's natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses with Dynegy's predecessor, NGC Corp. (former ticker NGL). NGC had been an integrated natural gas services company around since 1994. In 2009, AmerenUE signed an agreement to purchase 102 megawatts (MW) of wind power from phase II of Horizon Wind Energy's Pioneer Prairie Wind Farm in Iowa. That's enough to power 26,000 households. The power AmerenUE is purchasing will tie into the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) transmission grid, of which the company is a member, fulfilling AmerenUE's commitment to add 100 megawatts of renewable capacity to serve its Missouri customers by 2010. which failed on December 14, 2005, causing extensive damage to the east fork of the Black River and to Johnson's Shut-Ins State Park. Consequently, FERC fined Ameren $15 million. The State of Missouri has sued Ameren for actual and punitive damages, alleging Ameren recklessly operated the plant and put financial considerations from sale of power to other companies over safety, maintenance and engineering. The plant was operated by remote control with no one onsite during pumping operations. Rebuilding the upper reservoir of the AmerenUE Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric plant, cost $450 million and added 635 new jobs to the state's economy, while raising state income by $48 million, according to a study conducted by the Center for Economic &amp; Business Research at Southeast Missouri State University. The upper reservoir was constructed with roller compacted concrete (RCC); and online in 2010, this 54.5-acre (221,000&#160;m2) reservoir is the largest RCC dam in North America.  ^ Investor Relations - Board of Directors ^ Facts about Ameren, Accessdate: April 24, 2011 ^ a b c d e f ""Ameren, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Feb 28, 2012"" (PDF). secdatabase.com.

AEP ranks among the nation's largest generators of electricity, owning nearly 38,000&#160;megawatts of generating capacity in the U.S. AEP also owns the nation's largest electricity transmission system, a nearly 39,000-mile (63,000&#160;km)-network that includes 765&#160;kilovolt ultra-high voltage transmission lines, more than all other U.S. transmission systems combined. AEP's transmission system directly or indirectly serves about 10 percent of the electricity demand in the Eastern Interconnection, the interconnected transmission system that covers 38 eastern and central U.S. states and eastern Canada, and approximately 11 percent of the electricity demand in Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the transmission system that covers much of Texas. AEP's utility units operate as AEP Ohio, AEP Texas, Appalachian Power (in Virginia, West Virginia, and Tennessee), Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and Southwestern Electric Power Company (in Arkansas, Louisiana and east Texas). AEP's headquarters are in Columbus, Ohio. American Electric Power was the first utility to utilize 345&#160;kV transmission lines which took place in 1953. AEP has come under criticism in many of the states they operate in for attacking rooftop solar. They have specifically attempted to halt distributed solar in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Indiana, Kentucky, and Ohio. 1 Riverside Plaza AEP headquarters in Columbus, Ohio Contents 1 Subsidiaries 1.1 AEP Ohio 1.2 AEP Texas 1.3 Appalachian Power 1.4 Indiana Michigan Power 1.5 Kentucky Power 1.6 Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) 1.7 Southwestern Electric Power Company 1.8 Other subsidiaries 2 Coal 3 Nuclear 4 Hybrid technology 5 Solar and wind energy 6 PATH Proposal 7 History 7.1 Acquisitions 8 Environmental record 8.1 Justice Department lawsuit 9 Political influence 10 References 11 External links Subsidiaries AEP Texas was formed from a merger of various predecessor utilities, and joined AEP as part of its acquisition of Central and South West Corporation in 1997.

Kentucky Power serves most of Eastern Kentucky, the area abutting the Appalachian Power service area, including communities of Pikeville, Hazard and Ashland. It is headquartered in Frankfort, Kentucky. Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO) This anti-solar legislation was headed by Rep. Mike Turner (Oklahoma politician) (R. Edmond), known for both his support of ending rooftop solar and legislation he introduced to end all marriage in the state. After partnering with AEP to pass the legislation, Rep. Turner suffered a failed federal congressional race. In 2004, AEP announced their plans to build one, or more, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) coal-fired power plant which is expected to reduce emissions while providing additional electricity capacity to the customers served by AEP. The company also operates its own inland barge line, AEP River Operations (formerly MEMCO Barge Line), and owns major tracts of land throughout its service areas. In August 2008, AEP has formed a joint venture company with Duke Energy to build and own new electric transmission assets. It is the largest shareholder in the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC). OVEC is an associate company of AEP, not a subsidiary, because AEP owns less than half of it.

The ranking is based on the quantity (91,000,000 pounds (41,000&#160;t) in 2005) and toxicity of the emissions. The company will cut 813,000 short tons (738,000&#160;t) of air pollutants annually once all of the controls are installed. According to the press release, the agreement imposes caps on emissions of pollutants from 16 plants located in five states. The facilities are located in Moundsville (two facilities), St. Albans, Glasgow, and New Haven (two facilities), West Virginia; Louisa, Kentucky; Glen Lyn and Carbo, Virginia; Brilliant, Conesville, Cheshire, Lockbourne, and Beverly, Ohio; and Rockport and Lawrenceburg, Indiana.

It was founded as a joint stock corporation by the merger of the express companies owned by Henry Wells (Wells &amp; Company), William G. Fargo (Livingston, Fargo &amp; Company), and John Warren Butterfield (Wells, Butterfield &amp; Company, the successor earlier in 1850 of Butterfield, Wasson &amp; Company). Wells and Fargo also started Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in 1852 when Butterfield and other directors objected to the proposal that American Express extend its operations to California. American Express initially established its headquarters in a building at the intersection of Jay Street and Hudson Street in what was later called the Tribeca section of Manhattan. For years it enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the movement of express shipments (goods, securities, currency, etc.) throughout New York State. In 1874, American Express moved its headquarters to 65 Broadway in what was becoming the Financial District of Manhattan, a location it was to retain through two buildings. At the end of the Wells-Fargo reign in 1914, an aggressive new president, George Chadbourne Taylor (1868–1923), who had worked his way up through the company over the previous thirty years, decided to build a new headquarters. The old buildings, dubbed by the New York Times as ""among the ancient landmarks"" of lower Broadway, were inadequate for such a rapidly expanding concern. After some delays due to the war in Europe, the 21-story neo-classical American Express Co. Building was constructed in 1916–17 to the design of James L. Aspinwall, of the firm of Renwick, Aspinwall &amp; Tucker, the successor to the architectural practice of the eminent James Renwick, Jr.. The building consolidated the two lots of the former buildings with a single address: 65 Broadway. This building was part of the ""Express Row"" section of lower Broadway at the time. The building completed the continuous masonry wall of its block-front and assisted in transforming Broadway into the ""canyon"" of neo-classical masonry office towers familiar to this day American Express sold this building in 1975, but retained travel services there. The building was also the headquarters over the years of other prominent firms, including investment bankers J.&amp; W. Seligman &amp; Co. (1940–74), the American Bureau of Shipping, a maritime concern (1977–86), and currently J.J. Kenny, and Standard &amp; Poor's, who has renamed the building for itself. American Express extended its reach nationwide by arranging affiliations with other express companies (including Wells Fargo – the replacement for the two former companies that merged to form American Express), railroads, and steamship companies. Traveler's cheques established American Express as a truly international company. In 1914, at the onset of World War I, American Express in Europe was among the few companies to honor the letters of credit (issued by various banks) held by Americans in Europe, because other financial institutions refused to assist these stranded travelers. Loss of railroad express business American Express became one of the monopolies that President Theodore Roosevelt had the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) investigate during his administration. The interest of the ICC was drawn to its strict control of the railroad express business. However, the solution did not come immediately to hand. The solution to this problem came as a coincidence to other problems during World War I. During the winter of 1917, the United States suffered a severe coal shortage and on December 26 President Woodrow Wilson commandeered the railroads on behalf of the United States government to move federal troops, their supplies, and coal. Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo was assigned the task of consolidating the railway lines for the war effort. All contracts between express companies and railroads were nullified and McAdoo proposed that all existing express companies be consolidated into a single company to serve the country's needs. This ended American Express's express business, and removed them from the ICC’s interest. The result was that a new company called the American Railway Express Agency formed in July 1918. The new entity took custody of all the pooled equipment and property of existing express companies (the largest share of which, 40%, came from American Express, who had owned the rights to the express business over 71,280 miles (114,710&#160;km) of railroad lines, and had 10,000 offices, with over 30,000 employees). Investment banking American Express Tower (tallest, left) in New York City American Express executives discussed the possibility of launching a travel charge card as early as 1946, but it was not until Diners Club launched their card in March 1950 that American Express began seriously to consider the possibility. At the end of 1957, American Express CEO Ralph Reed decided to get into the card business, and by the launch date of October 1, 1958 public interest had become so significant that they issued 250,000 cards prior to the official launch date. The card was launched with an annual fee of $6, $1 higher than Diners Club, to be seen as a premium product. The first cards were paper, with the account number and cardmember's name typed. It was not until 1959 that American Express began issuing embossed ISO/IEC 7810 plastic cards, an industry first. In 1966, American Express introduced the Gold Card and in 1984 the Platinum Card, clearly defining different market segments within its own business, a practice that has proliferated across a broad array of industries. The Platinum Card was billed as super-exclusive and had a $250 annual fee (it is currently $450). It was offered by invitation only to American Express customers with at least 2 years of tenure, significant spending, and excellent payment history; it is now open to applications on request. In 1987, American Express introduced the Optima card, their first credit card product. Previously, all American Express cards had to be paid in full each month, but Optima allowed customers to carry a balance (the charge cards also now allow extended payment options on qualifying charges based on credit availability). Although American Express no longer accepts applications for the Optima brand of cards, since July 13, 2009, Optima cards are still listed on the American Express website, as a reference to existing members only. According to American Express, Optima accounts were not converted or closed. However, Blue from American Express has prevailed as the replacement for the original Optima style of credit card. Blue includes multiple benefits free of charge, unlike Optima, including the Membership Rewards program. In October 2012, The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced an enforcement action with orders requiring three American Express subsidiaries to refund an estimated $85 million to approximately 250,000 customers for illegal card practices. This action was the result of a multi-part federal investigation which found that at every stage of the consumer experience, from marketing to enrollment to payment to debt collection, American Express violated consumer protection laws. American Express sent letters to some previous customers: ""We invite you to apply for the Optima Card from American Express. This opportunity is in connection with a settlement solicitation, which did not clearly disclose that a settlement could prevent you from being approved for a new account with us in the future. This is in response to an enforcement action by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding this issue. Your attached application will be approved unless we determine that you do not have the financial capacity to make the minimum payment on this new Optima Card account, or we receive the application after 04/25/2013."" In April 1992, American Express spun off its subsidiary, First Data Corp., in an IPO. Then, in October 1996, the company distributed the remaining majority of its holdings in First Data Corp., reducing its ownership to less than 5%. In 1994, the Optima True Grace card was introduced. The card was unique in that it offered a grace period on all purchases whether a balance was carried on the card or not (as opposed to traditional revolving credit cards which charge interest on new purchases if so much as $1 was carried over). The card was discontinued a few years later; the now discontinued One from American Express card offered a similar feature called ""Interest Protection."" ""Boston Fee Party"" This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (March 2015) From early 1980s until the early 1990s, American Express was known for cutting its merchant fees (also known as a ""discount rate"") to merchants and restaurants if they accepted only American Express and no other credit or charge cards. This prompted competitors such as Visa and MasterCard to cry foul for a while as the tactics ""locked"" restaurants into American Express. The practice ended in 1991, as several restaurants in Boston started accepting and encouraging the use of Visa and MasterCard because of their far lower fees as compared to American Express' fees at the time (which were about 4% for each transaction versus around 1.2% at the time for Visa and MasterCard). A few even stopped accepting American Express credit and charge cards. The revolt, known as the ""Boston Fee Party"" (alluding to the Boston Tea Party), was orchestrated by a PR firm hired and paid by Discover Card. The campaign spread to over 250 restaurants across the United States, including restaurants in other cities such as New York City, Chicago, and Los Angeles. In response, American Express reduced its discount rate gradually to compete more effectively and add new merchants such as supermarkets and drugstores to its network. Many elements of the exclusive acceptance program were also phased out and American Express pursued other programs to effectively encourage businesses to add American Express cards to their existing list of payment options. Cable TV When a consumer makes a purchase using a credit or charge card, a small portion of the price is paid as a fee (known as the merchant discount), with the merchant keeping the remainder. There are typically three parties who split this fee amongst themselves: Acquiring bank: the bank which processes credit card transactions for a merchant, including crediting the merchant's account for the value charged to a credit card less all fees. Issuing bank: the bank which issues the consumer's credit card. This is the bank a consumer is responsible for repaying after making a credit card purchase. The issuer's share of the merchant discount is known as the interchange fee. Network: the link between acquiring banks and issuing banks. These banks have relationships with a network, rather than with each other, for fulfilling card purchases. This allows a card issued by a community bank in Peru to be used at a shop in South Africa, for instance, without requiring the banks to have a direct relationship with each other. The two largest networks in the world are Visa and MasterCard. American Express operates its own network. The average merchant discount in the United States is 1.9%. Of this, approximately 0.1% goes to the acquirer, 1.7% to the issuer, and 0.09% to the network. running on its proprietary network, these include consumer, small business and corporate cards issued by American Express themselves and cards issued by its Global Service Network partners that run on its network (Such as Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and NAB in Australia and Lloyds Bank and Barclays Bank in the UK). American Express is also the largest card issuer in the world based on purchase volume. An advertisement for the Platinum Card in Hong Kong."

North China Daily News Building on the Bund, Shanghai (elevation): the original home of what became AIG; now the AIA building. 70 Pine Street was known as the American International Building. The Early Years: 1919 to 1945 AIG traces its roots back to 1919, when American Cornelius Vander Starr (1892-1968) established a general insurance agency, American Asiatic Underwriters (AAU), in Shanghai, China. In 1926, Mr. Starr opened his first office in the United States, American International Underwriters Corporation (AIU). After World War II, American International Underwriters (AIU) entered Japan Greenberg focused on selling insurance through independent brokers rather than agents to eliminate agent salaries. Using brokers, AIU could price insurance according to its potential return even if it suffered decreased sales of certain products for great lengths of time with very little extra expense. In 1967, American International Group, Inc. (AIG) was incorporated as a unifying umbrella organization for most of C.V. Starr’s general and life insurance businesses. In 1984, AIG listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Throughout the 1990s, AIG developed new sources of income through diverse investments, including the acquisition of International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC), a provider of leased aircraft to the airline industry. Further information: Subprime mortgage crisis and Financial crisis of 2007–08 AIG faced the most difficult financial crisis in its history when a series of events unfolded in late 2008. AIG was bailed out by the federal government for $180 billion, and the government took control. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) made the major government study of the crisis. It concluded in January 2011: The Commission concludes AIG failed and was rescued by the government primarily because its enormous sales of credit default swaps were made without putting up the initial collateral, setting aside capital reserves, or hedging its exposure – a profound failure in corporate governance, particularly its risk management practices. AIG's failure was possible because of the sweeping deregulation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, including credit default swaps, which effectively eliminated federal and state regulation of these products, including capital and margin requirements that would have lessened the likelihood of AIG's failure. AIG had sold credit protection through its London unit in the form of credit default swaps (CDSs) on collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) but they had declined in value. The U.S. Department of the Treasury in December 2012 published an itemized list of the loans, stock purchases, special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and other investments engaged in with AIG, the amount AIG paid back and the positive return on the loans and investments to the government. AIG agreed in March 2010 to sell its American Life Insurance Co. (ALICO) to MetLife Inc. for $15.5 billion in cash and MetLife stock. The specific issue was whether the New York Federal Reserve transferred $18 billion in litigation claims on troubled mortgage debt through the Maiden Lane Transactions, entities created by the Fed in 2008, and thus prevented AIG from recouping losses from insured banks. On May 7, 2013, Los Angeles U.S. District Judge, Mariana Pfaelzer, ruled that $7.3 billion of the disputed claims had, in fact, not been assigned. AIG withdrew the case ""with prejudice"" on May 28, 2013. Praelzer was overseeing a suit between AIG and Bank of America (BAC-US) concerning possible misrepresentations by Merrill Lynch and Countrywide as to the quality of the mortgage portfolio. In signing the order closing the case, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan who also adjudicated the Maiden Lane case, American International Group Inc. et al. v. Maiden Lane II LLC, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-00951 admonished the Fed saying, ""On the face of it"" some of its actions ""perhaps are unattractive and, indeed, wrongful.”"

As with its U.S. financial planning business, Ameriprise India provides holistic financial planning services through its trained advisor force. Fees are received for delivering financial plans; however, Ameriprise India does not currently sell affiliated investment or insurance products, instead refers clients who elect to implement their financial plan to third-party product manufacturers to purchase recommended investment and/or insurance products. As of May 2014, Ameriprise has shut down the nascent financial planning division in India citing poor prospects for fee-based advisory services. Ameriprise Financial's headquarters is located at 55 Ameriprise Financial Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55474. It maintains executive offices at 7 World Trade Center, New York, New York 10007. Its offices in Wall Street, New York provides portfolio management, banking, marketing and various support functions. Ameriprise Financial's employee and franchised financial advisor branch offices are located throughout the United States. Columbia Management is based in Boston, and has investment management teams in Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York, Menlo Park and Portland. RiverSource Life has offices in Minneapolis, Green Bay, Phoenix, Boston, Los Angeles, New York and London. RiverSource Life Insurance Company of New York and American Centurion Life are located in Albany, New York. Ameriprise Advisor Center has locations in Minneapolis and Las Vegas. Ameriprise Auto &amp; Home Insurance is located in Green Bay, Las Vegas and Phoenix. Threadneedle is headquartered in Luxembourg and maintains its primary investment operations in London in the United Kingdom. Ameriprise Financial also has employees located in offices at Bangalore, the National Capital Region (WNS &amp; Infosys DLF Phase -3, Gurgaon) and Mumbai in India. Ameriprise advisors Ameriprise Financial advisors recommend actions and a broad range of products consisting of investment, annuity, insurance, banking and other financial products to clients based on an appropriate range and level of risk. The financial advisors charge clients for financial advice and selling products. There are four ways the financial advisors affiliate with Ameriprise Financial: Approximately 60% of Ameriprise's financial advisors are independent contractor franchisees — they are not employed by Ameriprise, but are licensed registered representatives of Ameriprise and do not receive a salary from the parent company. About one quarter of financial advisors are employed by Ameriprise (""employee financial advisors""). Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc. has the largest number of these professionals among any retail advisory force. Over 120 of the employee advisors work within the corporate office in Minneapolis as part of the Ameriprise Advisor Center (AAC). These Advisors are fully licensed Securities and Insurance professionals that have received additional training which allows them to assist clients exclusively by telephone. They are required to hold the Series 7 and Series 63 Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) licenses, along with insurance licenses in all states they serve, and are encouraged to acquire their Chartered Retirement Planning Counselor (CRPC) professional designation from the College of Financial Planning, and are reimbursed for the cost. The company also has associate Financial Advisors, employed by the independent contractor franchisees. On July 10, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced an enforcement action against Ameriprise for receiving millions of dollars in undisclosed revenue sharing as a condition for selling certain real estate investment trusts (REITs) to its brokerage customers. Ameriprise agreed to pay $17.3 million to settle the SEC's charges, however the period in which SEC states the violations took place were prior to the spinoff from American Express. On April 15, 2011, Securities America, Inc. (SAI) and its holding company, Securities America Financial Corporation, entered into settlement agreements related to the sale of private placement securities issued by Medical Capital and Provident Royalties that resulted in a $118 million pre-tax charge in the first quarter of 2011. The charge is in addition to a $40 million pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2010. On July 12, 2009 an advisor filed a complaint under 18 USC 1514(a) the whistleblower provisions of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. The case was filed with OSHA. OSHA determined the advisor was an independent contractor and not an employee. The advisor was referred to FINRA Arbitration. The Finra arbitration panel dismissed the case without a hearing- 4 years later. All of the advisors clients were transferred to other advisors and his practice was destroyed. He had no recourse to sell the equity in his practice in spite of a franchise agreement. The case is set to go before a Federal Appeals judge next month. See: DOL-ALJ website, case lookup, Ameriprise Financial. 2015 case dismissed. 2016 case now set for hearings. Ameriprise has settled other whistleblower complaints rather than have the facts reveled in public hearings. See: Loscalso v. Ameriprise. Ameriprise also has a class action lawsuit and an SEC investigation into the use of WRAP accounts."

Amphenol expanded significantly during World War II, when the company became the primary manufacturer of connectors used in military hardware, including airplanes and radios. From 1967 to 1982 it was part of Bunker Ramo Corporation. Amphenol's revenues in 2010 were $3.55 billion. The company sells its products into diverse electronics markets, including military-aerospace, industrial, automotive, information technology, mobile phones, wireless infrastructure, broadband, medical, and pro audio. Operations are located in more than 60 locations around the world. The company is included in the S&amp;P Midcap 400 index. Amphenol's Chairman is Dr. Martin H. Loeffler. Chief Executive Officer is R. Adam Norwitt. Amphenol's world headquarters is located in Wallingford, Connecticut. The largest division of Amphenol is Amphenol Aerospace (formerly Bendix Corporation) in Sidney, New York. This is the birthplace of the MIL-DTL-38999 cylindrical connector. Amphenol engineers also invented the commonly used BNC connector (""Bayonet Neill-Concelman""). Amphenol Cables on Demand, another division of Amphenol launched in December 2006, specializes in distributing standard cable assemblies via their e-commerce storefront. They sell more than 2500 audio, video, computer, and networking cables. Offices are located in New York, California, Florida, Toronto, and China. Acquisitions Notes ^ ""Amphenol Corp-CL A (APH:US)"".

In the fourth quarter of 2015, the company produced 836&#160;thousand barrels of oil equivalent (5,110,000&#160;GJ) per day. In 1999, the company announced that it would purchase a 7.5-acre (30,000&#160;m2) tract in The Woodlands, Montgomery County, Texas from the Woodlands Land Company and build an 800,000-square-foot (74,000&#160;m2), 32-story headquarters building, on the site. In October, 2011, Anadarko followed MOEX and agreed to settle with BP for $4 billion. BP agreed to ""forgo reimbursement for future costs related to the incident and will indemnify Anadarko for damage claims arising under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, among other costs. And Anadarko will transfer its 25% stake in Mississippi Canyon Block 252 (Macondo) to BP."" Anadarko then purchased the ""clean"" portion of Kerr-McGee free of its legacy of environmental dumping. In 2009, shareholders of Tronox sued Anadarko (successor to Kerr-McGee) for having misled investors about the large environmental and other debts Tronox would inherit from its parent corporation. ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa ab ac Anadarko Petroleum Corporation 2015 Form 10-K Annual Report ^ Anadarko Petroleum: Office locations ^ ""Anadarko towers symbolize business growth in The Woodlands"".

The company manufactures analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing (DSP) integrated circuits (ICs) used in electronic equipment. That same year, Jerald Fishman was named President and CEO, a position he held until his death in 2013 (see below). These technologies include data converters, amplifiers, radio frequency (RF) technologies, embedded processors or digital signal processing (DSP) ICs, power management, and interface products. Data converters include analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) Its data converters and amplifiers are also used by scientists and researchers in project “IceCube” – an underground telescope that uses digital optical modules (DOMS) to detect subatomic particles in the South Pole. Interface products include a broad range of interface IC products offered by the company in product categories such as CAN (controller area network), audio amplifiers, video amplifiers/buffers/filters, variable gain amplifiers, comparators, voltage, other specialty amplifiers and products for special linear functions. Analog Devices radio frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) The company’s RF portfolio includes TruPwr(tm) Analog Devices had a line of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) microphones until it sold that business to InvenSense in 2013. In 2009, Databeans published its report on the top semiconductor analog suppliers. Analog Devices was named number two with other suppliers including: Texas Instruments, National Semiconductor (acquired by Texas Instruments in 2011), EngineerZone was launched so the design engineering community (customers, prospects, partners, employees and students) can ask questions, share knowledge and search for answers to their questions in an open forum. ^ a b c d e f g h i j ""ANALOG DEVICES INC 2014 Annual Report Form (10-K)"" (XBRL).

The company is a provider of risk management, insurance and reinsurance brokerage, human resource solutions and outsourcing services. Aon is divided into three business units that each specialize in a particular line of business. The firm's risk management business, Aon Risk Solutions provides retail property/casualty, liability, and other insurance products for groups and businesses, as well as risk management services. Its reinsurance business, Aon Benfield, specializes in reinsurance brokerage and investment banking &amp; capital advisory (through Aon Securities Inc.). The firm's human resource solutions business, Aon Hewitt, provides consulting and outsourcing services to clients. This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2008) Aon Center, Los Angeles W. Clement Stone's mother bought a small Detroit insurance agency, and in 1918 brought her son into the business. Mr. Stone sold low-cost, low-benefit accident insurance, underwriting and issuing policies on-site. The next year he founded his own agency, the Combined Registry Co. As the Great Depression began, Stone reduced his workforce and improved training. Forced by his son's respiratory illness to winter in the South, Stone moved to Arkansas and Texas. In 1939 he bought American Casualty Insurance Co. of Dallas, Texas. It was consolidated with other purchases as the Combined Insurance Co. of America in 1947. The company continued through the 1950s and 1960s, continuing to sell health and accident policies. In the 1970s, Combined expanded overseas despite being hit hard by the recession. In 1982, after 10 years of stagnation under Clement Stone Jr., the elder Stone, then 79, resumed control until the completion of a merger with Ryan Insurance Co. allowed him to transfer control to Patrick Ryan. Ryan, the son of a Ford dealer in Wisconsin, had started his company as an auto credit insurer in 1964. In 1976, the company bought the insurance brokerage units of the Esmark conglomerate. Ryan focused on insurance brokering and added more upscale insurance products. He also trimmed staff and took other cost-cutting measures, and in 1987 he changed Combined's name to Aon. In 1992, he bought Dutch insurance broker Hudig-Langeveldt. In 1995, the company sold its remaining direct life insurance holdings to General Electric to focus on consulting. The following year, it began offering hostile takeover insurance policies to small and mid-sized companies. Aon built a global presence through purchases. In 1997, it bought The Minet Group, as well as insurance brokerage Alexander &amp; Alexander Services, Inc. in a deal that made Aon (temporarily) the largest insurance broker worldwide. The firm made no US buys in 1998, but doubled its employee base with purchases including Spain's largest retail insurance broker, Gil y Carvajal, and the formation of Aon Korea, the first non-Korean firm of its kind to be licensed there. Responding to industry demands, Aon announced its new fee disclosure policy in 1999, and the company reorganised to focus on buying personal line insurance firms and to integrate its acquisitions. That year it bought Nikols Sedgwick Group, an Italian insurance firm, and formed RiskAttack (with Zurich US), a risk analysis and financial management concern aimed at technology companies. The cost of integrating its numerous purchases, however, hammered profits in 1999. Despite its troubles, in 2000 Aon bought Reliance Group's accident and health insurance business, as well as Actuarial Sciences Associates, a compensation and employee benefits consulting company. Later in that year, however, the company decided to cut 6% of its workforce as part of a restructuring effort. In 2003, the company saw revenues increase primarily because of rate hikes in the insurance industry. Also that year, Endurance Specialty, a Bermuda-based underwriting operation that Aon helped to establish in November 2001 along with other investors, went public. The next year Aon sold most of its holdings in Endurance. In late 2007, Aon announced the divestiture of its underwriting business. With this move, the firm sold off its two major underwriting subsidiaries: Combined Insurance Company of America (acquired by ACE Limited for $2.4 billion) and Sterling Life Insurance Company (purchased by Munich Re Group for $352 million). The low margin and capital-intensive nature of the underwriting industry was the primary reason for the firm's decision to divest. In 2004–2005, Aon, along with other brokers including Marsh &amp; McLennan and Willis, fell under regulatory investigation under New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and other state attorneys general. At issue was the practice of insurance companies' payments to brokers (known as contingent commissions). The payments were thought to bring a conflict of interest, swaying broker decisions on behalf of carriers, rather than customers. In the spring of 2005, without acknowledging any wrongdoing, Aon agreed to a $190 million settlement, payable over 30 months. UK regulatory breach In December 2011, Aon Corporation paid a $16.26 million penalty to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Department of Justice (DOJ) for violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). ^ a b c d e f g h ""Aon plc 2013 Annual Report Form (10-K)"" (XBRL).

Christmann IV, CEO &amp; President Products Petroleum Natural gas Production output 438&#160;thousand barrels of oil equivalent (2,680,000&#160;GJ) per day Revenue US$6.383 billion (2015) Net income -US$22.348 billion (2015) Total assets US$18.842 billion (2015) Total equity US$4.228 billion (2015) Number of employees 3,860 (2015) In 2015, the company's total production was 195&#160;thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,190,000&#160;GJ) per day, of which 47% was in the United States, 13% was in Canada, 27% was in Egypt, and 13% was in the North Sea. As of December 31, 2015, the company had 1.564&#160;billion barrels of oil equivalent (9.57×109&#160;GJ) of estimated proved reserves, of which 54% was in the United States, 18% was in Canada, 19% was in Egypt, and 9% was in the North Sea. In 1969, Apache Corporation became a public company via an initial public offering and its shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:&#160;APA). In 1971, it formed Apache Exploration Company (subsequently “Apexco”) as its oil and gas operating company. In 1981, the company created Apache Petroleum Company (APC), the first public master limited partnership in the United States. In 2012, Apache completed the acquisition of Cordillera Energy Partners in a deal worth $2.5 billion in cash and 6.3 million shares of common stock. The acquisition added approximately 71&#160;million barrels of oil equivalent (430,000,000&#160;GJ) to Apache's reserves and strengthened its position across western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. On June 1, 2013 an Apache pipeline in northern Alberta, Canada was noticed to have ruptured, spilling 60,000 barrels (9.5 million litres) of toxic waste in what was cited as one of the largest of such disasters in recent history in North America. ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l Apache Corporation 2015 Form 10-K ^ a b c d e f g Apache Corporation History: 1954-1979 ^ Apache: Alternate Paths ^ a b c d Apache Corporation History: 1980s ^ ""Market Place: The Apache Partnership"".

Its businesses provide a diverse set of specialty, niche-market insurance products in the property, casualty, life and health insurance sectors. The company’s two operating segments are Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property. The company, formerly known as Fortis, Inc., was spun off from Dutch and Belgian financial-services company Fortis Insurance N.V. in 2004. The company’s initial public offering on Feb. 5, 2004 at $1.76 billion was the fourth largest that year. In connection with the public offering, the company changed its name to Assurant, Inc. In 1978, N.V. AMEV of the Netherlands acquired the Time Insurance Company (now Assurant Health) via its U.S. holding company AMEV Holdings, Inc.

In September 2009, the South Carolina Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s verdict and ordered the firm (then known as ""Fortis"") to pay $10 million to a policyholder, who had contracted HIV subsequent to getting an insurance policy. In court proceedings, it was revealed that the company's policy was to target every policyholder recently diagnosed with HIV for an automatic fraud investigation, as the company searched for any pretext to revoke (""rescind"") their policy. As in that case, their insurance policies often were canceled on incorrect information, flimsy evidence, or for no reason at all. ^ ""Management Committee"". Assurant.com.

AT&amp;T is the third-largest company in Texas (the largest non-oil company, behind only ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, and also the largest Dallas company). AT&amp;T Inc. began its existence as Southwestern Bell Corporation, one of seven Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOC's) created in 1983 in the divestiture of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (founded 1885, later AT&amp;T Corp.) following the 1982 United States v. AT&amp;T antitrust lawsuit. Southwestern Bell changed its name to SBC Communications Inc. in 1995. In 2005, SBC purchased former parent AT&amp;T Corp. and took on its branding, with the merged entity naming itself AT&amp;T Inc. and using the iconic AT&amp;T Corp. logo and stock-trading symbol. The current AT&amp;T reconstitutes much of the former Bell System and includes ten of the original 22 Bell Operating Companies, along with the original long distance division. Main article: History of AT&amp;T AT&amp;T can trace its origin back to the original Bell Telephone Company founded by Alexander Graham Bell after his invention of the telephone. One of that company's subsidiaries was American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T), established in 1885, which acquired the Bell Company on December 31, 1899 for legal reasons, leaving AT&amp;T as the main company. AT&amp;T established a network of subsidiaries in the United States and Canada that held a government-authorized phone service monopoly, formalized with the Kingsbury Commitment, throughout most of the twentieth century. This monopoly was known as the Bell System, and during this period, AT&amp;T was also known by the nickname Ma Bell. For periods of time, the former AT&amp;T was the world's largest phone company. In 1982, US regulators broke up the AT&amp;T monopoly, requiring AT&amp;T to divest its regional subsidiaries and turning them each into individual companies. These new companies were known as Regional Bell Operating Companies, or more informally, Baby Bells. AT&amp;T continued to operate long distance services, but as a result of this breakup, faced competition from new competitors such as MCI and Sprint. Southwestern Bell was one of the companies created by the breakup of AT&amp;T. The company soon started a series of acquisitions. This includes the 1987 acquisition of Metromedia mobile business, and the acquisition of several cable companies in the early 1990s. In the later half of the 1990s, the company acquired several other telecommunications companies, including some Baby Bells, while selling its cable business. During this time, the company changed its name to SBC Communications. By 1998, the company was in the top 15 of the Fortune 500, and by 1999 the company was part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (lasting through 2015). Since 2005 Bill Leahy, representing AT&amp;T, sits on the Private Enterprise Board of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). AT&amp;T supported the Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 3675; 113th Congress), a bill that would make a number of changes to procedures that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) follows in its rulemaking processes.

Further information: NSA call database, Mark Klein, NSA warrantless surveillance controversy, Hepting v. AT&amp;T In 2006, the Electronic Frontier Foundation lodged a class action lawsuit, Hepting v. AT&amp;T, which alleged that AT&amp;T had allowed agents of the National Security Agency (NSA) to monitor phone and Internet communications of AT&amp;T customers without warrants. If true, this would violate the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 and the First and Fourth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. AT&amp;T has yet to confirm or deny that monitoring by the NSA is occurring. In April 2006, a retired former AT&amp;T technician, Mark Klein, lodged an affidavit supporting this allegation. AT&amp;T is accused by community media groups of discriminating against local Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable TV channels:, by ""impictions that will severely restrict the audience"".

Beveridge (Chairman) Carl Bass (CEO) Products See text Revenue US$2.512&#160;billion (2014) US$2.312&#160;billion (2013) Operating income US$284.8&#160;million (2014) US$305.9&#160;million (2013) Net income US$228.8&#160;million (2014) US$247.4&#160;million (2013) Total assets US$4.595&#160;billion (2014) US$4.308&#160;billion (2013) Total equity US$2.261&#160;billion (2014) US$2.043&#160;billion (2013) Number of employees 7,700 (2014) in its San Francisco building. The company has offices worldwide, with U.S. locations in Northern California, Oregon, and in New England in New Hampshire and Massachusetts, and Canada locations in Ontario, Quebec, and Alberta. The company was founded in 1982 by John Walker, a coauthor of the first versions of AutoCAD, the company's flagship computer-aided design (CAD) software. Its AutoCAD and Revit software is primarily used by architects, engineers, and structural designers to design, draft, and model buildings and other structures. Autodesk software has been used in many fields, from the New York Freedom Tower A screenshot of AutoCAD, Autodesk's flagship product. The Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB) division develops and manages the product foundation for most Autodesk offerings across multiple markets, including Autodesk's flagship product AutoCAD, AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD for Mac, and AutoCAD 360. Autodesk Suites, Subscription and Web Services, which includes Autodesk Cloud, Autodesk Labs, and Global Engineering are also part of PSEB. In what was seen as an unusual step for a maker of high-end business software, Autodesk began offering AutoCAD LT 2012 for Mac through the Apple Mac App Store. The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry group is headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, in a LEED Platinum building Autodesk's architecture, engineering, and construction solutions include AutoCAD-based design and documentation software such as AutoCAD Architecture (formerly Architectural Desktop), AutoCAD MEP (formerly Autodesk Building Systems), and AutoCAD Civil 3D. Their flagship product for relational Building information modeling is Revit. Revit is available as Revit Architecture, Revit Structure, Revit MEP or an all-in-one product. The AEC division also develops and manages software for the Construction industry, including Buzzsaw, Constructware, and the NavisWorks (acquired 2007) product tools; the Infrastructure industry, including AutoCAD Civil 3D, AutoCAD Map3D, and AutoCAD MapGuide Enterprise; and the Plant industry, including AutoCAD P&amp;ID and AutoCAD Plant 3D. Projects that have used software from the Autodesk AEC division include the NASA Ames building, Autodesk develops and purchased many specific-purpose renderers but many Autodesk products are bundled with third-party renderers such as NVIDIA MentalRay or Iray. Autodesk Raytracer (ART) - a simple raytracing renderer Autodesk A360 Render - a simple cloud renderer Lagoa MultiOptics Renderer - a cloud renderer for visualization Autodesk VRED - a OpenGL/offline renderer bundled within Autodesk Alias AutoStudio package Autodesk Realtime Renderer (formerly VSR Realtime Renderer) - a raytracing renderer for Rhinoceros 3D Autodesk Real Time Ray Tracing (Autodesk RTRT; formerly Opus RTRT) - a raytracing rendering engine used in Autodesk Opticore Studio Maya Hardware - a GPU renderer in Maya Quicksilver - a DirectX renderer in 3ds Max Lightscape - a discontinued radiosity renderer; its technologies were merged within Autodesk VIZ (later 3ds Max Design). Some of Autodesk's ""retired"" products are listed here: Lightscape 3.2 Was the world's only radiosity rendering package at the time (1991) developed from work done by Donald Greenberg at the Cornell University Department of Computer Graphics. The problem with this part of Autodesk's history is that it was a time of discovery in computer graphics, and Cornell was one of the birthplaces for the technology. In this sense Lightscape was more than just another product, it was an essential part of the development of rendering technology generally, and part of its evolution. Additionally the software came from a university research department and represented the start of a development cycle that users the world over were watching closely. Regardless, Autodesk purchased rights to the software and promptly discontinued its sale. A very primitive version of the radiosity renderer was incorporated into the companies 3d Studio Max product, whilst existing Lightscape customers and the product were simply dropped. The most likely reason for this was that Lightscape offered a number of features that were simply too ahead of its time and therefore did not offer the optimum economic return for the company. Volo View was a web-enabled review and markup tool from Autodesk for engineering data, including support for Autodesk's DWG, DXF, and DWF formats. Volo View enabled design teams to communicate ideas and review designs without access to AutoCAD software. Autodesk discontinued sales of Volo View on May 1, 2005. The latest version of the software, Volo View 3, worked with the following file formats: AutoCAD 2004, DWG and DXF; Design Web Format (DWF 6); Autodesk Inventor 7 IPT, IAM, and IDW and raster files. The functionality of this product is largely replaced by Autodesk DWF Composer (versions 1 and 2) later replaced by the free Autodesk Design Review. Autodesk has also released a free product called DWG TrueView. This product enables users to view and plot AutoCAD DWG and DXF files, and to publish these same files to the DWF file format. Autodesk Animator Pro (DOS) and Autodesk Animator Studio (Windows) were products designed for cell based animation produced between the early-to-mid-1990s. At the time Autodesk was also advertising an Autodesk Media product similar in description to Macromedia Director but this product was never released to the public. Cyberspace by Autodesk was an early real-time 3D environment capable of producing basic phong shaded walkthroughs of DXF format models in ""realtime"". No textures were supported, and the system was able to support a maximum DXF model size of around 35 KB. A popular demo model of the Parthenon in Greece was shown around the United States in a tour of the portable demo system – complete with virtual reality goggles. AutoCAD Survey (Autodesk Survey) Civil Design AutoCAD Civil 3D Land Desktop Companion (AutoCAD Land Desktop) AutoCAD Freestyle, released in April 26, 2010 and discontinued January 31, 2011. Inventor Fusion was discontinued August 23, 2014 due to redundancies with Fusion 360. Autodesk's first notable product was AutoCAD, a computer-aided design application designed to run on the systems known as ""microcomputers"" at the time, including those running the 8-bit CP/M operating system and two of the new 16-bit systems, the Victor 9000 and the IBM Personal Computer (PC). This tool allowed users to create detailed technical drawings, and was affordable to many smaller design, engineering, and architecture companies. Release 2.1 of AutoCAD, released in 1986, included AutoLISP, a built-in Lisp programming language interpreter initially based on XLISP. This opened the door for third party developers to extend AutoCAD's functionality, to address a wide range of vertical markets, strengthening AutoCAD's market penetration. Subsequent to AutoCAD Release 13, the company stopped supporting the Unix environment and the Apple Macintosh platform. After AutoCAD Release 14 (R13 was last DOS &amp; Unix release), first shipped in 1997, Autodesk discontinued development under MS-DOS, and focused exclusively on Microsoft Windows. AutoCAD has grown to become the most widely used CAD program for 2D non-specialized applications. The native file formats written by AutoCAD, DXF and DWG, are also widely used for CAD data interoperability. In the 1990s, with the purchase of Softdesk in 1997, Autodesk started to develop specialty versions of AutoCAD, targeted to broad industry segments, including architecture, civil engineering, and manufacturing. Since the late 1990s, the company has added a number of significant non-AutoCAD-based products, including Revit, a parametric building modeling application (acquired in 2002, from Massachusetts-based Revit Technologies for $133 million), and Inventor, an internally developed parametric mechanical design CAD application. In Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc., Autodesk was sued in 2007 by Timothy Vernor, who alleged that he was entitled to sell on eBay ""used"" copies of AutoCAD software he had obtained at an office liquidation sale from an Autodesk licensee. The Court ruled in Vernor's favor, holding that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale (non-recurring price, right to perpetual possession of copy) it was, in fact, a ""sale with restrictions on use"" On October 16, 1992, Autodesk acquired Micro Engineering Solutions (MES) Inc., a leading developer and marketer of manufacturing CAD / CAM software founded by Lynn and Jim Hock and Bill Harris, and headed by president and CEO Ken Spenser On March 16, 1999, Autodesk acquired Discreet Logic Inc.

On December 18, 2002, Autodesk acquired the assets of truEInnovations, Inc for an undisclosed amount. The assets were used to create the application Autodesk Vault. On March 4, 2003, Autodesk acquired Linius Technologies, Inc. and purchased certain assets of a third software company—VIA Development Corporation, for an undisclosed amount. On February 24, 2004, Autodesk acquired MechSoft, Inc., an Autodesk Inventor(R) Certified Applications Program partner and developer of the MechSoft product. On March 2005, Autodesk acquired the assets of COMPASS systems GmbH for 13 Mio Euro, a European-based developer of the COMPASS family of data management solutions. The assets were used to strengthen Autodesk's position in the European product data management market. On October 23, 2008, Autodesk announced the acquisition on Avid's Softimage, Co. business, developers of 3D application Softimage (formerly Softimage|XSI), for $35 million USD. On December 2009, Autodesk announced the acquisition of VisualTAO (also known as PlanPlatform), an Israeli start-up that developed a cloud-based Web application, enabling users to view and edit AutoCAD files online. The company also developed a mobile version of the application. VisualTAO became part of PSEB, and the product was released during 2010 as ""AutoCAD WS"". On July 21, 2010, Autodesk announced the acquisition of Illuminate Labs, the maker of Beast (a global illumination middleware) and Turtle (a global illumination plugin for Maya) used for video game development. On December 16, 2011, Autodesk announced the acquisition of Horizontal Systems, a provider of cloud-based BIM (Building Information Modeling) collaboration solutions for the AEC (architecture, engineering and construction) industry.

When appropriate, blatant advertising may be marked for speedy deletion with {{db-spam}}. (September 2013) Autodesk solutions for Digital Prototyping allow designers, manufacturers and engineers to design more sustainably by reducing the amount of physical prototypes required for a project, or eliminating the need for them entirely. The Building Information Modeling (BIM) capabilities of Autodesk software help the architect, engineering and construction (AEC) industry create more sustainable buildings and optimize building performance. Autodesk took Graphisoft's ArchiCAD's earlier Virtual Building concept from 1987 and has continued to develop it as Building Information Modelling since around 2003. Widespread BIM adoption is a more recent phenomenon. Autodesk's Simulation CFD includes a range of CFD modeling and thermal modeling tools for architectural and MEP applications. Common applications for environmental sustainable design include mechanical ventilation, external flow (wind loading), natural ventilation, and occupant comfort. Other energy applications include analysis for building energy, solar load, advanced energy and heating and cooling. Autodesk introduced C-FACT, an open-source, science-driven approach to setting greenhouse gas reduction targets, which calls for greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions to be made in proportion to a company’s gross domestic product (GDP). Unlike other carbon accounting methods, Autodesk’s C-FACT measures carbon dioxide emissions that are proportional to a company’s global GDP contribution. Autodesk’s solutions are available for the public sector through Carahsoft, their reseller network, and partners, through a large variety of contract vehicles including GSA Schedule 70, SEWP-V, CMaaS BPA, and various other state and local contracts."

Maine, in 1844, as a jewelry- and watch-box manufacturing company located in the Dunlap Block of Maine Street. Five years later Aaron turned the Dennison Manufacturing Company over to his younger brother, Eliphalet Whorf Dennison, who took over and developed the company into a significant-size industrial enterprise. It was in 1898 that the business moved to a location in Framingham, Massachusetts. (Aaron Dennison went on to co-found the Waltham Watch Company in 1850, a leader in the American system of watch manufacturing using interchangeable parts.) Office and Consumer Products Avery Dennison created a separate division for office products such as binders, file labels and name badges in 1982. The division and its products, sold under the Avery brand and logo, contrasted with the company’s larger materials division in that its products were finished (“converted”) materials, and they were aimed at consumers as well as businesses. Over the next 30 years, the division grew, as personal computing created a market for printable media both at home and at work. However, with the rise of email and the decline in conventional mail, the office products market as a whole began to decline. On July 1, 2013, Avery Dennison completed the sale of Office and Consumer Products and a second business, Designed and Engineered Solutions, to CCL Industries. CCL purchased the Avery office products brand along with the business. Avery Dennison retains its full name, brand and logo. Operations The company is headquartered in Glendale, California. It ranked number 375 on the 2013 Fortune 500 list with total sales of $6.8 billion. Sales from continuing operations were $6.0 billion. Its main line of business is self-adhesive materials for labeling and branding; its Pressure-Sensitive Materials segment was responsible for 71 percent of 2012 sales from continuing operations. The company operates in more than 50 countries and employs 26,000 people worldwide. Its first overseas subsidiary was established in the Netherlands in 1955. The company operates through two segments: The Pressure-Sensitive Materials segment manufactures and sells pressure-sensitive roll-label materials, films for graphic applications, reflective highway-safety products, a variety of specialized tapes, performance polymers, and extruded films. The Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment designs, manufactures, and sells various branding and information management products and solutions for apparel and general retail, including tickets, graphic, barcode and radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, labels and inserts, woven and printed labels, external embellishments, price management systems, a variety of fasteners, and related supplies and equipment. The company also operates Vancive Medical Technologies, which provides products such as wearable sensors, barrier films, wound dressings and a variety of tapes and securement products for the healthcare industry.

Their combined history dates back to the early 1900s. During its history, Baker Hughes has acquired and assimilated numerous oilfield pioneers including: Brown Oil Tools, CTC, EDECO, and Elder Oil Tools (completions); Milchem and Newpark (drilling fluids); EXLOG (mud logging); Eastman Christensen and Drilex (directional drilling and diamond drill bits); Teleco (measurement while drilling); Tri-State and Wilson (fishing tools and services); Aquaness, Chemlink and Petrolite (specialty chemicals), Western Atlas (seismic exploration, well logging), BJ Services Company (pressure pumping). Hughes Tool Company's oil drill manufacturing plant in downtown Houston, 1915. The Hughes Tool Company was founded in 1908 by business partners Walter Benona Sharp and Howard R. Hughes, Sr., father of Howard R. Hughes, Jr.. That year, Hughes, Sr. and Sharp developed the first two-cone drill bit, designed to enable rotary drilling in harder, deeper formations than was possible with earlier fishtail bits. They conducted two secret tests on a drilling rig in Goose Creek, Texas. Each time, Hughes asked the drilling crew to leave the rig floor, pulled the bit from a locked wooden box, and then his associates ran the bit into the hole. The drill pipe twisted off on the first test, but the second was extremely successful. In 1909, the Sharp &amp; Hughes bit was granted a U.S. patent. In the same year, the partners formed the Sharp-Hughes Tool Company in Houston, Texas to manufacture the bit in a rented space measuring 20 by 40&#160;ft (12&#160;m). After Walter Sharp died in 1912, Hughes purchased Sharp's half of the business. The company was renamed Hughes Tool Company in 1915, and Hughes, Jr. inherited it after his father's death in 1924. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Hughes Tool Company remained a private enterprise, owned by Hughes. While Hughes was engaged in his Hollywood and aviation enterprises, managers in Houston, such as Fred Ayers and Maynard Montrose, kept the tool company growing through technical innovation and international expansion. In 1958, the Engineering and Research Laboratory was enlarged to accommodate six laboratory sections that housed specialized instruments, such as a direct reading spectrometer and x-ray diffractometer. In 1959, Hughes introduced self-lubricating, sealed bearing rock bits. After collecting data from thousands of bit runs, Hughes introduced the first comprehensive guides to efficient drilling practices in 1960; 1964 saw the introduction of the X-Line rock bits, combining new cutting structure designs and hydraulic jets. Baker International was formed by Reuben C. Baker, who developed a Casing shoe, that revolutionized cable tool drilling. In July 1907, R.C. Baker, a 34-year-old inventor and entrepreneur in Coalinga, California, was granted a U.S. patent for a casing shoe that enabled drillers to efficiently run casing and cement it in oil wells. This innovation launched the business that would become Baker Oil Tools and Baker Hughes Incorporated. Mr. Baker had arrived in the California oilfield in 1895 with 95 cents in his pocket and dreams of making his fortune in the Los Angeles oil boom. Subsequently, he hauled oil for drillers with a team of horses and became a drilling contractor and an oil wildcatter before achieving success as an innovator in oilfield equipment. In 1928, Baker Casing Shoe Company changed its name to Baker Oil Tools, Inc., to reflect its product line of completion, cementing and fishing equipment. In early 1956, during one of the most successful periods in the company's history, Reuben C. Baker retired as President of Baker Oil Tools. A few weeks later, he died after a brief illness at the age of 85 and was succeeded by his long-time associate Ted Sutter. Although he only had three years of formal education, Mr. Baker had been granted 150 patents. In 1965, Mr. Sutter was succeeded by E.H. ""Hubie"" Clark, who would become the first Baker Hughes chairman of the board in 1987; during its 80-year history before the Baker Hughes merger, Baker had only three chief executives. INTEQ also originally incorporated the drilling fluids division of Baker Hughes which consisted of Milpark and others. This division was called 'INTEQ drilling fluids' which provided the premier brands in oil and gas well drilling muds and wellbore cleaning fluids. In 2003, these product lines were spun off to form the separate entity of Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids (BHDF), with INTEQ continuing as the Drilling and Evaluation (D&amp;E) company. INTEQ provides directional Drilling, MWD/LWD, surface logging (Mudlogging) and coring services. The company's flagship brand has been the AutoTrak rotary steerable drilling system which was a pioneering directional drilling tool and has been responsible for the company's relatively strong market share in the past few years. of ""pushing and pointing (vectoring) the bit"" rather than only ""pointing the bit"" or only ""pushing the bit"". In 2007, Baker Hughes pled guilty in U.S. federal court to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), including bribing oil-related industry officials in Russia, Uzbekistan, Angola, Indonesia, and Nigeria., Under the settlement, a unit of the Houston-based company pleaded guilty to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) for payments made between 2001 and 2003 to a commercial agent retained in 2000 in connection with a project in Kazakhstan. After bribes were paid, Baker Hughes was awarded an oil-services contract in a Karachaganak, Kazakhstan field that generated $219 million in revenues from 2001 to 2006. Labor action In November 2014 Halliburton proposed the acquisition of Baker Hughes, which would unite the second and third largest U.S. providers of oil field services. Under the terms of the transaction, Baker Hughes shareholders will receive 1.12 shares of Halliburton common stock and $19.00 in cash for each share of Baker Hughes stock they own. Merge has been approved by both Companies Stockholders and currently is waiting on approval from several jurisdictions on concerns on monopoly, US, EU, Brazil and Australia regulators are concerned that the deal between the second and third largest players (Schlumberger is the largest in the industry) in the oilfield service providing industry will adversely affect the level of competition, prices and consumer welfare in the country. Undoubtedly, the merger will lead to increased consolidation in the oil services market. Also, officials believe that the asset sale will not help the combined company retain competitiveness, as smaller buyers will not utilize their larger rivals’ assets efficiently. Outside of the US Halliburton-Baker Hughes deal has received clearance from Kazakhstan, Canada, Turkey, South Africa, and Colombia.

Milchem Newpark Aquaness In 1931, Max B. Miller devised a drilling mud using a white clay as a weighting material. To market the new mud, he formed The Milwhite Company in Texas. In the mid-1930s, the company mined barites in conjunction with the Magnet Cove Barium Corporation (later called Magcobar). After a hiatus during World War II, the company resumed grinding operations using barite from a mine in Missouri and conducted mud sales through independent distributors. After 1956 Milwhite Mud Sales Company built its own sales network. In 1963 the company acquired the Aquaness chemical company, and in 1964 the combination became Milchem Incorporated. In 1971, Baker Oil Tools acquired Milchem. In 1985, Baker International acquired the drilling fluids division of Newpark Resources and merged it with Milchem's mud division to form Milpark. Meanwhile, in 1942, Oil Base Drilling Company was founded by George Miller, and made its first application of oil base mud. The company was acquired by Hughes Tool Company in 1979, and renamed Hughes Drilling Fluids in 1982. In 1987, when Baker Hughes was formed, Hughes Drilling Fluids was merged into Milpark, and in 1993, Milpark became a product line within Baker Hughes INTEQ. Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids was established as a stand-alone division in 2004. Mud logging and Well monitoring EXLOG Production Quest In 1952, in Sacramento, California a group of Stanford University engineering and geology graduates founded Exploration Logging Company (EXLOG) to provide geologic mud logging services from mobile logging units using technical innovations in hot-wire gas detection. Vern Jones was the company's first president. EXLOG would become a world leader in surface logging, rig instrumentation and data acquisition. Baker International acquired EXLOG in 1972, and invested in its expansion. By 1982, the company had more than 200 logging units and 1,000 geologists on staff. Its broad expertise in geological services would eventually become the Surface Logging Service product line of Baker Hughes INTEQ. Directional drilling and diamond drill bits in 1978. Schlumberger introduced the LWD service in 1980. The legacy MWD company Teleco Oilfield Services Inc. was integrated into a new division, to be known as Eastman Teleco in 1992. The division then merged the directional drilling products and services once marketed by the Eastman Christensen division with Teleco's measurement-while-drilling (MWD) services. In January 1992, Baker Hughes agreed to purchase Teleco from Sonat Inc. for $200 million cash, preferred stock and royalty from future sales of Teleco's ""triple combo"" sensors. Before the acquisition, Teleco was recognized Petrolite - 1997 William Barnickel's Tret-O-Lite business in 1920 had outgrown his initial manufacturing plant, so he built a new one in Webster Groves, Missouri. The ingenious new facility had six times the capacity of the old plant and was built on a hillside so that raw materials were unloaded from a railroad line on the top of the hill, and the chemicals flowed through the plant using the force of gravity. Finished product was loaded on rail cars at the bottom of the hill. In 1922, the company sold 10,815 drums of Tret-O-Lite demulsifier, representing a recovery of 50 million barrels (7,900,000&#160;m3) of oil from produced oil/water emulsion. In 1923, Mr. Barnickel died at age of 45, of a perforated ulcer, and John S. Lehmann succeeded him as Tret-O-Lite president. Meanwhile, Frederick Cottrell and James Speed were developing electrostatic methods for separating oil from water. In 1911, Allen C. Wright formed the Petroleum Rectifying Company of California (PETRECO), which built electric dehydrating plants—based on Contrell's and Speed's inventions—to serve California oilfields. By 1922, Petreco had 417 treaters in operation, but was running into competition from Barnickel and his chemical process. In 1930, as the worldwide Depression began, the two competing companies—PETRECO and Tret-O-Lite—merged to form Petrolite Wireline logging and perforating, and geophysical exploration Canadian Perforator Dialog - a Wedge Division Dresser Atlas Du-Al Well Services Elgen Corporation Heartland Kingfisher Lane Wells NL McCullogh Pacific Oil Tool, Ltd. PetroTech (former name of the wireline operations of Lane Wells in Venezuela) PGAC - Pan Geo Atlas Corporation PML RIS SIE Western Atlas - 1998 (previously formed by the merger of Dresser Atlas &amp; Western Geophysical) WSI Z&amp;S Geoscience, Ltd. In 1932, Bill Lane and Walt Wells invented bullet gun perforating and formed the Lane-Wells Company in Vernon, California. They performed their first job on Union Oil's La Merced #17 well in Los Angeles. The company that would become Western Atlas (later Baker Atlas) grew quickly and added other wireline services, including the gamma ray log in 1939 and the neutron log in 1941, which were developed by Well Surveys Inc., an affiliated company. In 1948, a Lane-Wells crew performed the company's 100,000th job on La Merced #17, the site of the first perforating run. In 1963, Baker Atlas predecessor Lane-Wells introduced the Neutron Lifetime Log service, providing the ability to detect oil through well casing, and initiating the line of Baker Atlas pulsed-neutron logging tools for cased hole logging and reservoir monitoring. It took another five years for competitors to introduce a comparable service. Beginning in 1948, Well Surveys Inc. physicist Arthur Youmans led the team of engineers and scientists to develop this technology. The highly complex instrument included a miniaturized particle generator and sensors to detect and analyze sub-atomic particles. Mr. Youmans went on to become Vice President of Research and Engineering for Dresser Atlas. In 1968, Lane-Wells and the Pan Geo Atlas Corporation (PGAC) merged to form Dresser Atlas, a name chosen to “position” the company as more than a perforating provider and as part parent company of Dresser Industries. A competitor with Lane-Wells but possessing deeper expertise and an international reputation in open hole logging, PGAC was the perfect merger partner to form an integrated wireline services company. Since its inception, Lane-Wells had generated most of its income from perforating services, but log interpretation had narrowed down producing zones, resulting in fewer perforations and less revenue. During the oil slump of the 1999, Western Atlas was acquired by Baker Hughes and the wireline division was created within the company rebranded as Baker Atlas. Western Geophysical was meanwhile allied with GecoPrakla of Schlumberger and later combined into a separate business entity called WesternGeco."
Ball_Corp," Ball Corporation Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;BLL S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Packaging, Aerospace Founded 1880 Headquarters Broomfield, Colorado, U.S. Key people John A. Hayes, CEO Products Metal containers, Packaging, Space manufacturing Revenue US$14.630 Billion (FY 2013) Operating income US$468.6 million (FY 2011) Net income US$466.3 million (FY 2011) Total assets US$7.285 billion (FY 2011) Total equity US$1.219 billion (FY 2011) The company has expanded into other areas such as avionics, space systems, metal beverage and food containers and aluminum aerosol containers. Ball is the largest producer of recyclable beverage cans in the world. The company exited the home canning business in 1993 by spinning it off into a separate company, Alltrista (since renamed Jarden). In 1880, Frank C. and Edmund B. Ball, two of the five Ball brothers of fruit jar fame, borrowed $200 from their Uncle George Harvey Ball, founder and first president of Keuka College, to buy the Wooden Jacket Can Company (years later the brothers would reciprocate by providing financial support to their uncle's college). The wooden jackets encased tin cans which held kerosene. Because the acid used to refine kerosene caused corrosion in tin, the brothers decided to use glass for the inserts of the wood-jacketed cans. Initially, they bought the glass containers from a factory in Poughkeepsie, New York. In 1882, the factory that supplied the glass containers was destroyed by fire. Some of the glassblowers from that factory suggested to the Ball brothers that they build their own factory. They purchased land in East Buffalo and built a two-story brick building for the stamping works and a one-story frame factory for the glass works. Because of the volume of business, a larger furnace was soon needed. In order to use the full capacity of the furnace, it was decided to make other glass products. Sometime in 1884, Frank and Edmund discovered that the patent covering the Mason Improved fruit jar had expired. This meant that they could make the fruit jars in the glass works and the metal lids in the metal factory. The “Buffalo” jars were made for part of 1884, 1885 and 1886. The BBGMCo (Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing Company) logo was used on the jars, which were either amber or aqua. Sizes ranged from half-gallon to pint and midget. In 1886, while on a business trip in Cleveland, Frank heard about the gas boom in Findlay, Ohio. After visiting Findlay, Frank told Edmund about the advantages of natural gas for glass making. Edmund then visited several towns in the gas fields, including Muncie, Indiana. After he returned, he and Frank decided that they should make a more extensive trip to investigate the possibility of locating a factory in a gas boom town. They briefly had doubts about extending beyond Buffalo but decided that to grow their glass business, they had to explore the possibility of taking advantage of gas. Frank and Edmund stopped first in Fostoria, Ohio where they were enthusiastically welcomed. The next stop was Bowling Green. After one night in town, Edmund returned to Buffalo. When Frank had been in Bowling Green for about a week, he received a telegram from James Boyce of Muncie. Frank said that “Having become weary of the monotonous life in Bowling Green and ready for a change, I decided to run down to Muncie and see what they had to offer.” Frank was courted by the town leaders, and according to him, “There was nothing about the town that particularly appealed to me, but the men were all courteous, kind, and businesslike.” Frank agreed to a proposal which included a factory site of seven acres, a gas well and cash. In addition, the city agreed to provide railroad facilities. By September, 1887, construction had begun on the Muncie factory. Frank remained in Muncie after getting the factory up and running. That same year, Edmund closed the Buffalo glass factory and moved to Muncie. Their brothers, William and George, remained in Buffalo to operate the stamping works and a factory in Bath, New York. However, George moved to Muncie by 1893 and William by 1897. Their eldest brother, Lucius, received his doctor of medicine degree from the University of Buffalo in 1889. He served as the house physician in Adrian Hospital in Pennsylvania then practiced in Buffalo. He moved to Muncie in 1894. On February 7, 1888, a Certificate of Incorporation was filed for the Ball Glass Works of Muncie. On February 18, fires were started in the furnace, on February 26, the blowers began to arrive and on March 1, the first products were made. The first products made in Muncie were coal oil containers and lamp chimneys, not fruit jars. Ball remained a family-owned business for more than 90 years, manufacturing fruit jars, lids, and related products. In the 1950s, Ball entered the aerospace industry. Glass production in Muncie ceased in 1962 but continued at other Ball plants. Ball went public on July 13, 1972, and its stock was traded over the counter. On December 17, 1973, the stock was admitted for trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BLL. Stock began trading at $26 per share. Company headquarters moved from Muncie to Broomfield, Colorado in 1998. Ball no longer produces the glass fruit jar; the license to produce the jar now is owned by Jarden Home Brands. Jarden produces all lids for all brands of fruit jars at its Muncie plant. Jars are made by a variety of glass producers.

Expansion outside California Following the passage of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, BankAmerica Corporation was established for the purpose of owning and operation of Bank of America and its subsidiaries. Bank of America expanded outside California in 1983 with its acquisition of Seafirst Corporation of Seattle, Washington, and its wholly owned banking subsidiary, Seattle-First National Bank. Seafirst was at risk of seizure by the federal government after becoming insolvent due to a series of bad loans to the oil industry. BankAmerica continued to operate its new subsidiary as Seafirst rather than Bank of America until the 1998 merger with NationsBank. BankAmerica experienced huge losses in 1986 and 1987 by the placement of a series of bad loans in the Third World, particularly in Latin America. The company fired its CEO, Sam Armacost. Though Armacost blamed the problems on his predecessor, A.W. (Tom) Clausen, Clausen was appointed to replace Armacost. The losses resulted in a huge decline of BankAmerica stock, making it vulnerable to a hostile takeover. First Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles (which had originated from banks once owned by BankAmerica), launched such a bid in the fall of 1986, although BankAmerica rebuffed it, mostly by selling operations. It sold its FinanceAmerica subsidiary to Chrysler and the brokerage firm Charles Schwab and Co. back to Mr. Schwab. It also sold Bank of America and Italy to Deutsche Bank. By the time of the 1987 stock market crash, BankAmerica's share price had fallen to $8, but by 1992 it had rebounded mightily to become one of the biggest gainers of that half-decade. The Bank of America Tower in New York City. BankAmerica's next big acquisition came in 1992. The company acquired its California rival, Security Pacific Corporation and its subsidiary Security Pacific National Bank in California and other banks in Arizona, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington (which Security Pacific had acquired in a series of acquisitions in the late 1980s). This was, at the time, the largest bank acquisition in history. Federal regulators, however, forced the sale of roughly half of Security Pacific's Washington subsidiary, the former Rainier Bank, as the combination of Seafirst and Security Pacific Washington would have given BankAmerica too large a share of the market in that state. The Washington branches were divided and sold to West One Bancorp (now U.S. Bancorp) and KeyBank. Later that year, BankAmerica expanded into Nevada by acquiring Valley Bank of Nevada. In 1994, BankAmerica acquired the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co. of Chicago, which had become federally owned as part of the same oil industry debacle emanating from Oklahoma City's Penn Square Bank, that had brought down numerous financial institutions including Seafirst. At the time, no bank possessed the resources to bail out Continental, so the federal government operated the bank for nearly a decade. Illinois at that time regulated branch banking extremely heavily, so Bank of America Illinois was a single-unit bank until the 21st century. BankAmerica moved its national lending department to Chicago in an effort to establish a financial beachhead in the region. Pyramid-shaped former Bank of America branch building towers over Interstate 410 in San Antonio, Texas. These mergers helped BankAmerica Corporation to once again become the largest U.S. bank holding company in terms of deposits, but the company fell to second place in 1997 behind North Carolina's fast-growing NationsBank Corporation, and to third in 1998 First Union Corp. On the capital markets side, the acquisition of Continental Illinois helped BankAmerica to build a leveraged finance origination and distribution business (Continental Illinois had extensive leveraged lending relationships) which allowed the firm’s existing broker-dealer, BancAmerica Securities (originally named BA Securities), to become a full-service franchise. Logo of the former Bank of America (BA), 1969-1998 In 1997, Bank of America lent D. E. Shaw &amp; Co., a large hedge fund, $1.4&#160;billion in order to run various businesses for the bank. While NationsBank was the nominal survivor, the merged bank took the better-known name of Bank of America. Hence, the holding company was renamed Bank of America Corporation, while NationsBank, N.A. merged with Bank of America NT&amp;SA to form Bank of America, N.A. as the remaining legal bank entity. The combined bank still operates under Federal Charter 13044, which was granted to Giannini's Bank of Italy on March 1, 1927. However, the merged company is headquartered in Charlotte and retains NationsBank's pre-1998 stock price history. Additionally, all U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings before 1998 are listed under NationsBank, not Bank of America. NationsBank president, chairman and CEO Hugh McColl took on the same roles with the merged company. Bank of America possessed combined assets of $570&#160;billion, as well as 4,800 branches in 22 states. Despite the mammoth size of the two companies, federal regulators insisted only upon the divestiture of 13 branches in New Mexico, in towns that would be left with only a single bank following the combination. (Branch divestitures are only required if the combined company will have a larger than 25% Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit market share in a particular state or 10% deposit market share overall.) In addition, the combined broker-dealer, created from the integration of BancAmerica Robertson Stephens and NationsBanc Montgomery Securities, was renamed Banc of America Securities in 1998. Hundreds of FleetBoston workers lost their jobs or were demoted, according to the Boston Globe. On June 30, 2005, Bank of America announced it would purchase credit card giant MBNA for $35&#160;billion in cash and stock. The Federal Reserve Board gave final approval to the merger on December 15, 2005, and the merger closed on January 1, 2006. The acquisition of MBNA provided Bank of America a leading domestic and foreign credit card issuer. The combined Bank of America Card Services organization, including the former MBNA, had more than 40 million U.S. accounts and nearly $140&#160;billion in outstanding balances. Under Bank of America the operation was renamed FIA Card Services. Bank of America Footprint In May 2006, Bank of America and Banco Itaú (Investimentos Itaú S.A.) entered into an acquisition agreement through which Itaú agreed to acquire BankBoston's operations in Brazil and was granted an exclusive right to purchase Bank of America's operations in Chile and Uruguay. The deal was signed in August 2006 under which Itaú agreed to purchase Bank of America's operations in Chile and Uruguay. Prior to the transaction, BankBoston's Brazilian operations included asset management, private banking, a credit card portfolio, and small, middle-market, and large corporate segments. It had 66 branches and 203,000 clients in Brazil. BankBoston in Chile had 44 branches and 58,000 clients and in Uruguay it had 15 branches. In addition, there was a credit card company, OCA, in Uruguay, which had 23 branches. BankBoston N.A. in Uruguay, together with OCA, jointly served 372,000 clients. While the BankBoston name and trademarks were not part of the transaction, as part of the sale agreement, they cannot be used by Bank of America in Brazil, Chile or Uruguay following the transactions. Hence, the BankBoston name has disappeared from Brazil, Chile and Uruguay. The Itaú stock received by Bank of America in the transactions has allowed Bank of America's stake in Itaú to reach 11.51%. Banco de Boston de Brazil had been founded in 1947. On November 20, 2006, Bank of America announced the purchase of The United States Trust Company for $3.3&#160;billion, from the Charles Schwab Corporation. US Trust had about $100&#160;billion of assets under management and over 150 years of experience. The deal closed July 1, 2007. In March 2008, it was reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was investigating Countrywide for possible fraud relating to home loans and mortgages. Bank of America received $20&#160;billion in the federal bailout from the U.S. government through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) on January 16, 2009, and a guarantee of $118&#160;billion in potential losses at the company. Then CEO Ken Lewis was quoted as claiming ""We are still lending, and we are lending far more because of the TARP program."" Members of the U.S. House of Representatives, however, were skeptical and quoted many anecdotes about loan applicants (particularly small business owners) being denied loans and credit card holders facing stiffer terms on the debt in their card accounts. According to a March 15, 2009, article in The New York Times, Bank of America received an additional $5.2&#160;billion in government bailout money, channeled through American International Group. As a result of its federal bailout and management problems, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Bank of America was operating under a secret ""memorandum of understanding"" (MOU) from the U.S. government that requires it to ""overhaul its board and address perceived problems with risk and liquidity management"". With the federal action, the institution has taken several steps, including arranging for six of its directors to resign and forming a Regulatory Impact Office. Bank of America faces several deadlines in July and August and if not met, could face harsher penalties by federal regulators. Bank of America did not respond to The Wall Street Journal story. On December 2, 2009, Bank of America announced it would repay the entire $45&#160;billion it received in TARP and exit the program, using $26.2&#160;billion of excess liquidity along with $18.6&#160;billion to be gained in ""common equivalent securities"" (Tier 1 capital). The bank announced it had completed the repayment on December 9. Bank of America's Ken Lewis said during the announcement, ""We appreciate the critical role that the U.S. government played last fall in helping to stabilize financial markets, and we are pleased to be able to fully repay the investment, with interest.... As America's largest bank, we have a responsibility to make good on the taxpayers' investment, and our record shows that we have been able to fulfill that commitment while continuing to lend."" On August 3, 2009, Bank of America agreed to pay a $33&#160;million fine, without admission or denial of charges, to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the non-disclosure of an agreement to pay up to $5.8&#160;billion of bonuses at Merrill. The bank approved the bonuses before the merger but did not disclose them to its shareholders when the shareholders were considering approving the Merrill acquisition, in December 2008. The issue was originally investigated by New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who commented after the suit and announced settlement that ""the timing of the bonuses, as well as the disclosures relating to them, constituted a 'surprising fit of corporate irresponsibility'"" and ""our investigation of these and other matters pursuant to New York's Martin Act will continue."" Congressman Kucinich commented at the same time that ""This may not be the last fine that Bank of America pays for how it handled its merger of Merrill Lynch."" under chairman Edolphus Towns (D-NY) Downsizing (2011 to 2014) Much of the government's prosecution was based on information provided by three whistleblowers - Shareef Abdou (a senior vice president at the bank), Robert Madsen (a professional appraiser employed by a bank subsidiary) and Edward O'Donnell (a Fannie Mae official). The three men received $170 million in whistleblower awards. Consumer Banking is the largest division in the company, and provides financial services to consumers and small businesses. The acquisition of FleetBoston and MBNA significantly expanded its size and range of services, resulting in about 51% of the company's total revenue in 2005. It competes primarily with the retail banking arms of America's three other megabanks: Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo. The Consumer Banking organization includes over 5,800 retail branches and over 18,000 ATMs across the United States. Bank of America is a member of the Global ATM Alliance, a joint venture of several major international banks that until the end of 2013 allowed customers of the banks to use their ATM card or check card at another bank within the Global ATM Alliance without access fees when traveling internationally. A change of policy means that customers are now charged 3% of funds withdrawn from ATMs overseas. Other participating banks are Barclays (United Kingdom), BNP Paribas (France), Ukrsibbank (Ukraine), China Construction Bank (China), Deutsche Bank (Germany), Santander Serfin (Mexico), Scotiabank (Canada) and Westpac (Australia and New Zealand). Before Bank of America's acquisition of Merrill Lynch, the Global Corporate and Investment Banking (GCIB) business operated as Banc of America Securities LLC. The bank's investment banking activities operate under the Merrill Lynch subsidiary and provided mergers and acquisitions advisory, underwriting, capital markets, as well as sales &amp; trading in fixed income and equities markets. Its strongest groups include Leveraged Finance, Syndicated Loans, and mortgage-backed securities. It also has one of the largest research teams on Wall Street. Bank of America Merrill Lynch is headquartered in New York City. Investment management Global Wealth and Investment Management (GWIM) manages assets of institutions and individuals. It is among the 10 largest U.S. wealth managers (ranked by private banking assets under management in accounts of $1&#160;million or more as of June 30, 2005). In July 2006, Chairman Ken Lewis announced that GWIM's total assets under management exceeded $500&#160;billion. GWIM has five primary lines of business: Premier Banking &amp; Investments (including Bank of America Investment Services, Inc.), The Private Bank, Family Wealth Advisors, and Bank of America Specialist. Bank of America has spent $675&#160;million building its U.S. investment banking business and is looking to become one of the top five investment banks worldwide. ""Bank of America already has excellent relationships with the corporate and financial institutions world. Its clients include 98% of the Fortune 500 companies in the U.S. and 79% of the Global Fortune 500. These relationships, as well as a balance sheet that most banks would kill for, are the foundations for a lofty ambition."" Bank of America has a new headquarters for its operations at the Bank of America Tower, New York City. The skyscraper is located on 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas, at Bryant Park, and features state-of-the-art, environmentally friendly technology throughout its 2.1&#160;million square feet (195,096 m²) of office space. The building is the headquarters for the company's investment banking division, and also hosts most of Bank of America's New York-based staff. An April 21, 2012 article by The New York Times named the Bank of America as a corporate member of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Bank of America operated under the name BankBoston in many other Latin American countries, including Brazil. In 2006, Bank of America sold BankBoston's operations to Brazilian bank Banco Itaú, in exchange for Itaú shares. The BankBoston name and trademarks were not part of the transaction and, as part of the sale agreement, cannot be used by Bank of America (ending the BankBoston brand). Bank of America's Global Corporate and Investment Banking has its U.S. headquarters in New York, European headquarters in London, and Asian headquarters in Hong Kong. Frank P.

On February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a historic settlement with the federal government and 49 states. The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in direct payments to the states and federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement.

Baxter chief executive Vernon Loucks fired Fuisz who then brought anti-boycott charges against Baxter to the U.S. Commerce Department Office of Anti-Boycott Compliance (OAC). Fuisz alleged that Baxter had sold their profitable Ashdod facility to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1988 In 2011, Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC completed the acquisition of Baxter Healthcare Corporation's US generic injectables business (Multi-Source Injectables or MSI). In July 2014, Baxter announced that it was exiting the vaccines business—divesting its commercial vaccine portfolio to Pfizer (with sale expected to close by the end of the year) and exploring options for its vaccines R&amp;D program, including influenza.

Founded in 1897 and headquartered in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, BD employs nearly 30,000 people in more than 50 countries throughout the world. In 1948, BD faced new leadership as Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr. and Henry P. Becton, sons of the founders, took over the company. Their 24-year tenure was a time of rapid development for BD. The company grew within the U.S. as well as internationally. In 1949, it opened its first manufacturing site outside of New Jersey in Columbus, Nebraska. In 1961, it established a manufacturing facility in Canaan, Connecticut. BD also soon expanded to Canada (1951), Mexico (1952), France (1955), and Brazil (1956). The tenure of Fairleigh S. Dickinson, Jr. and Henry P. Becton was also a time of significant product innovation. In 1950, BD's first sterile disposable product, a blood collection set, was developed and sold to the American Red Cross. In 1954, BD introduced the first completely disposable syringe made of glass: BD Hypak. This innovative product was used in a large-scale field test of the polio vaccine developed by Dr. Jonas Salk. One year later, BD entered the microbiology field through the acquisition of the Baltimore Biological Laboratory. In 1961, the company introduced its disposable BD Plastipak syringe. Under the new leadership the company also went public (1962) and appeared for the first time in the Fortune 500 list (1970). In 1973, BD added another U.S. facility—a research center in Durham, North Carolina in Research Triangle Park. The center was established to help the company meet United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements, research improved manufacturing and process methods, and develop future innovative technologies. In 1975, BD Pharmaceutical Systems Europe acquired an important patent for a prefilled syringe injecting heparin. In 1980, BD developed its first automated system for mycobacteria testing—the BD BACTEC 460TB System. The next year brought significant signs of the company’s development as sales surpassed the $1 billion milestone and a new plant in Plymouth, England was constructed to serve the European markets. Five years later BD moved its corporate headquarters to Franklin Lakes, New Jersey (current HQ location.) Also in 1986, BD acquired Fabersanitas Industrial, a major Spanish syringe manufacturer as well as Deseret Medical, a vascular access devices manufacturer. The last three years of the 1980s also showed growth in Asia (manufacturing facilities in Singapore and Japan.) Furthermore, BD became the first company to introduce a safety-engineered syringe—BD Safety-Lok (1988) and acquired the Beaver Blade Company, a manufacturer of high-quality surgical blades. The first half of the next decade was very important to BD’s development. The company opened a central distribution center in Temse, Belgium (1992) and entered India and China (1995.) BD also introduced a device that offered needle stick protection following blood-drawing procedures—BD Vacutainer Safety-Lok Blood Collection Set. In 1999, as BD passed more than 100 years of presence in the medical devices industry, BD announced its new corporate identity. Numerous independent brand names were replaced by a single name: BD. In addition, the company symbol that is used today was introduced. BD also named Edward J. Ludwig as the company’s president. Ludwig was also named Chief Executive Officer (2000) and Chairman of the Board of Directors (2002). On February 9, 1999, BD announced the acquisition of Biometric Imaging, Inc. (BMI), a privately held company serving the transfusion medicine, infectious diseases, and oncology markets. During that time, BD also got heavily involved in global health issues announcing a five-year maternal and neonatal tetanus world-wide elimination partnership with UNICEF (1999), launching the BD Safety Compliance Initiative (2000), and pledging $1 million contribution to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (2002.) In 2003 and 2004, BD introduced several innovative products: BD FACSAria Cell Sorter—the first entirely new instrument in the next-generation portfolio of flow cytometers (2003), BD Accuspray—a nasal drug delivery system for administering vaccines (2003), BD.id—a patient identification system designed to limit the potential for medical errors in specimen collection (2003), and the world's first ""intelligent"" insulin pump and glucose monitoring system, a wireless system consisting of a Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm 512 Insulin Pump and Paradigm Link Blood Glucose Monitor, co-developed with BD. In the beginning of the 21st century BD also invested in growing its business by acquiring several strategically important companies. In 2001, it acquired the Gentest Corporation, a leading in drug metabolism and toxicology testing company. In 2004, BD completed the acquisition of Atto Bioscience Acquired, a company specializing in optical instrumentation, software, and reagents for real-time analysis of interactions taking place in living cells. In 2005 BD entered the field of proteomics through its acquisition of FFE Weber GmbH, which specialized in the separation and fractionation of complex proteins. 2006 was also an important year to document BD's growth as the company acquired GeneOhm Sciences—a leader in the development of molecular diagnostic testing for the rapid detection of bacterial organisms and TriPath Imaging—a cancer diagnostics company. Becton Dickinson is divided into three business segments: BD Medical (52% of FY 09 revenues) BD Diagnostics (31% of FY 09 revenues), and BD Biosciences (17% of FY 09 revenues.) Global Business Coalition on Health (GBCHealth), BD has also donated millions to Fairleigh Dickinson University (of which BD co-founder Dickinson was a benefactor and namesake), in support of the Henry P. Becton School of Nursing and Allied Health (named for the son of BD's co-founder, also a BD executive), along with other FDU programs."

Berkshire_Hathaway," Berkshire Hathaway Formerly called Valley Falls Company (1839-1955) Type Public Traded&#160;as Class A NYSE:&#160;BRK.A Class B NYSE:&#160;BRK.B S&amp;P 500 Component (BRK.B) Industry Conglomerate Founded Cumberland, Rhode Island, United States 1839; 177&#160;years ago&#160;(1839) Founder Oliver Chace Headquarters Kiewit Plaza, Omaha, Nebraska, United States Area served Worldwide Key people Warren Buffett (Chairman, President, and CEO) Charlie Munger (Vice Chairman) Marc Hamburg (CFO and Senior VP) Products Diversified investments, property and casualty insurance Revenue US$210.82 billion (2015) Operating income US$34.94 billion (2015) Net income US$24.08 billion (2015) Total assets US$552.25 billion (2015) Total equity US$255.55 billion (2015) Number of employees 331,000 (2015) and an undisclosed percentage of Mars, Incorporated, and has significant minority holdings in American Express, The Coca-Cola Company, Wells Fargo, IBM and Restaurant Brands International. Berkshire Hathaway averaged an annual growth in book value of 19.7% to its shareholders for the last 49 years (compared to 9.8% from the S&amp;P 500 with dividends included for the same period), while employing large amounts of capital, and minimal debt. Instead of selling at the slightly lower price, Buffett decided to buy more of the stock to take control of the company and fire Stanton (which he did). However, this put Buffett in a situation where he was now majority owner of a textile business that was failing. Buffett initially maintained Berkshire's core business of textiles, but by 1967, he was expanding into the insurance industry and other investments. Berkshire first ventured into the insurance business with the purchase of National Indemnity Company. In the late 1970s, Berkshire acquired an equity stake in the Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO), which forms the core of its insurance operations today (and is a major source of capital for Berkshire Hathaway's other investments). In 1985, the last textile operations (Hathaway's historic core) were shut down. In 2010, Buffett claimed that purchasing Berkshire Hathaway was the biggest investment mistake he had ever made, and claimed that it had denied him compounded investment returns of about $200&#160;billion over the subsequent 45 years. Buffett claimed that had he invested that money directly in insurance businesses instead of buying out Berkshire Hathaway (due to what he perceived as a slight by an individual), those investments would have paid off several hundredfold. Corporate affairs This section's factual accuracy may be compromised due to out-of-date information. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (May 2013) Kiewit Tower, the location of Berkshire's corporate offices in Omaha, Nebraska Berkshire's class A shares sold for $227,720 as of December 23, 2014 Buffett defended Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein's $13.2&#160;million pay package when the company had taken and not yet paid back $10&#160;billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) money from the United States Department of Treasury. Berkshire's vice-chairman, Charlie Munger, also holds a stake big enough to make him a billionaire, and early investments in Berkshire by David Gottesman and Franklin Otis Booth, Jr. resulted in their becoming billionaires as well. Bill Gates' Cascade Investment LLC is the second largest shareholder of Berkshire and owns more than 5% of class B shares. Berkshire Hathaway has never split its Class A shares because of management's desire to attract long-term investors as opposed to short-term speculators. However, Berkshire Hathaway created a Class B stock, with a per-share value originally kept (by specific management rules) close to 1⁄30 of that of the original shares (now Class A) and 1⁄200 of the per-share voting rights, and after the January 2010 split, at 1⁄1,500 the price and 1⁄10,000 the voting rights of the Class-A shares. Holders of class A stock are allowed to convert their stock to Class B, though not vice versa. Buffett was reluctant to create the class B shares, but did so to thwart the creation of unit trusts that would have marketed themselves as Berkshire look-alikes. As Buffett said in his 1995 shareholder letter: ""The unit trusts that have recently surfaced fly in the face of these goals. They would be sold by brokers working for big commissions, would impose other burdensome costs on their shareholders, and would be marketed en masse to unsophisticated buyers, apt to be seduced by our past record and beguiled by the publicity Berkshire and I have received in recent years. The sure outcome: a multitude of investors destined to be disappointed."" Berkshire's annual shareholders' meetings, taking place in the CenturyLink Center in Omaha, Nebraska, are routinely visited by 20,000 people. The current members of the board of directors of Berkshire Hathaway are Warren Buffett (CEO), Charlie Munger, Walter Scott, Jr., Thomas S. Murphy, Howard Graham Buffett (Warren's son), Ronald Olson, Charlotte Guyman, David Gottesman, Bill Gates, Steve Burke, Susan Decker, and Meryl Witmer.. All of Berkshire’s major insurance subsidiaries are rated AAA by Standard &amp; Poor’s Corporation, the highest Financial Strength Rating assigned by Standard &amp; Poor’s, and are rated A++ (superior) by A. M. Best with respect to their financial condition and operating performance. GEICO – Berkshire acquired GEICO in January 1996.. General Re subsidiaries currently conduct global reinsurance business in approximately 72 cities and provide reinsurance coverage worldwide. General Re operates the following reinsurance businesses: North American property/casualty, international property/casualty, which principally consists of Cologne Re and the Faraday operations, and life/health reinsurance. General Re’s reinsurance operations are primarily based in Stamford, Connecticut, and Cologne, Germany. General Re is one of the largest reinsurers in the world based on net premiums written and capital. NRG (Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep) – Berkshire acquired NRG, a Dutch life reinsurance company, from ING Group in December 2007. In August 2000, Berkshire entered the building products business with the acquisition of Acme Building Brands. Acme, headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, manufactures and distributes clay bricks (Acme Brick), concrete block (Featherlite) and cut limestone (Texas Quarries). It expanded its building products business in December 2000, when it acquired Benjamin Moore &amp; Co. of Montvale, New Jersey. Moore formulates, manufactures and sells architectural coatings that are available primarily in the United States and Canada. In 2001, Berkshire acquired three additional building products companies. In February, it purchased Johns Manville which was established in 1858 and manufactures fiber glass wool insulation products for homes and commercial buildings, as well as pipe, duct and equipment insulation products. In July, Berkshire acquired a 90% equity interest in MiTek Inc., which makes engineered connector products, engineering software and services, and manufacturing machinery for the truss fabrication segment of the building components industry and is headquartered in Chesterfield, Missouri. Berkshire acquired Clayton Homes, a maker of modular homes, storage trailers, chassis, intermodal piggyback trailers and domestic containers. Clayton's finance business, (loans to manufactured home owners), earned $206&#160;million down from $526&#160;million in 2007. Loan losses remain 3.6% up from 2.9%. In 2006 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. acquired Russell Corporation for $600 million, in fact getting most shares and brands in many sports leagues - like Spalding NBA official basketballs, BIKE Athletic Company protections, AAI (American Athletic) Gymnastics' tables, bars, rings, horses or Dudley softball balls and accessories.

Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;BLK S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Investment management Founded 1988 Headquarters 40 East 52nd Street New York, NY 10022 U.S. Area served Worldwide Key people Laurence Fink (Chairman &amp; CEO) Robert Kapito (Co-President) Products Asset management Revenue US$ 10.50 billion (2013) Net income US$ 2.932 billion (2013) AUM US$ 4.50 trillion (2015) Total assets US$ 219.87 billion (2013) Total equity US$ 26.46 billion (2013) Number of employees 12,000 Fink, Kapito, Golub and Novick had worked together at First Boston, where Fink and his team were pioneers in the mortgage-backed securities market in the United States. During Fink's tenure, he had lost $100 Million as head of First Boston. That experience was the motivation to develop what he and the others considered to be excellent risk management and fiduciary. Initially, Fink sought funding (for initial operating capital) from Pete Peterson of the The Blackstone Group L.P. who believed in Fink's vision of a firm devoted to risk management. Peterson called it Blackstone Financial Management. In 1992, due to internal confusion, the decision was made to change their name from Blackstone Financial Management to BlackRock. In 1995, Blackstone Group's Stephen A. Schwarzman and Fink had an internal dispute over equity. Fink wanted to share equity with his employees. Schwarzman did not. They agreed to part ways, so the BlackRock partners, (Sue Wagner) orchestrated a deal with PNC Financial Services Group. In 1995, BlackRock closed the deal with PNC Financial Services Group, while continuing to be managed independently. In 1998, PNC’s equity, liquidity, and mutual fund activities were merged into BlackRock. BlackRock went public in 1999 at $14 a share. The deal included the mutual-fund business State Street Research Management and closed in January 2005. In September 2006, BlackRock merged with Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (MLIM), halving PNC's ownership and giving Merrill Lynch a 49.5% stake in the company. In October 2007, BlackRock acquired the fund-of-funds business of Quellos Capital Management. In December 2009, the company acquired Barclays Global Investors (BGI) from Barclays. BGI was headquartered in San Francisco, with research and portfolio management teams in London, Sydney, Tokyo, Toronto, and other cities. BlackRock also acquired BGI's iShares funds. 2010 onwards On 1 April 2011, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) replaced Genzyme (NASDAQ:GENZ) on the S&amp;P 500 index. In 2000, BlackRock launched BlackRock Solutions, the risk management division of BlackRock, Inc. The division grew from the Aladdin System (which is the enterprise investment system), Green Package (which is the Risk Reporting Service) PAG (portfolio analytics) and AnSer (which is the interactive analytics). BlackRock Solutions (BRS) serves two roles within BlackRock. First, BlackRock Solutions is the in-house investment analytics and “process engineering” department for BlackRock which works with their portfolio management teams, risk and quantitative analysis, business operations and every other part of the firm that touches the investment process. Second, BlackRock Solutions (BRS) and the three primary divisions (which include risk management investment platform solutions, FMA, and client solutions) are services that offered to institutional clients. As of 2013, the platform had nearly 2,000 employees. to manage the toxic mortgage assets (i.e. to analyze, unwind, and price) that were owned by Bear Stearns, AIG, Inc., Freddie Mac, Morgan Stanley, and other financial firms that were affected in the 2008 financial crisis.

Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;HRB S&amp;P 500 Component Founded 1955; 61&#160;years ago&#160;(1955) Kansas City, Missouri, U.S. Founder Henry Bloch Richard Bloch Headquarters Kansas City, Missouri, U.S. Area served United States, Canada, Australia, India, Brazil Key people William Cobb (CEO) Greg Macfarlane (CFO) Robert Gerard (Chairman) Products Tax Preparation Banking Business Services Revenue $ 3.1 billion (FY 2015) Net income $ 474 million (FY 2015) Total assets $ 4.5 billion (FY 2015) Total equity $ 1.8 billion (FY 2015) Number of employees 2,200 (April 2015) Website hrblock.com H&amp;R Block World Headquarters building in Kansas City, Missouri. H&amp;R Block is a tax preparation company in North America, Australia, Brazil and India. The Kansas City-based company also offers banking, payroll, personal finance, and business consulting services. Founded in 1955 by brothers Henry W. Bloch and Richard Bloch, Block today operates approximately 12,000 retail tax offices worldwide. Block offers its own consumer tax software (formerly TaxCut), as well as online tax preparation and electronic filing from their website.

The company stated that it had ""insufficient resources"" to identify and report complex transactions in its corporate tax accounting. On February 23, 2006, the company said in its quarterly results that it had miscalculated its own state income taxes for 2005 and 2004, and that it owed an additional $32 million in back taxes. That mistake, plus Block's lower-than-expected earnings for the quarter, caused its stock price to drop by 8.5 percent in one day. At April 30, 2008, the company's liability recorded for ""uncertain tax positions"" totaled $137.6 million (excluding related interest and penalties). According to H&amp;R Block, ""This liability represents an estimate of tax positions we have taken in our tax returns that may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities."" Estimated gross interest and penalties relating to these potential assessments totaled an additional $47.5 million. On Feb. 15, 2006, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer sued H&amp;R Block, alleging the company's refund anticipation loan (RAL) business violated state and federal laws in its marketing and providing of high-cost RALs mainly to low-income clients. Block responded that it ""believes the refund lending program is both fair and legal, and will vigorously defend against the complaint"". On January 2, 2009, California Attorney General Edmund G. Brown Jr. reached a $4.85 million settlement with H&amp;R Block, which prohibits the company from deceptively marketing high-cost refund anticipation loans as early ""tax refunds"". Consumers received up to $2.45 million in restitution if they purchased a ""refund anticipation loan"" or a ""refund anticipation check"" through H&amp;R Block between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2008. In addition, H&amp;R Block agreed to pay $500,000 in penalties and $1.9 million in fees and costs. ^ a b c d e f henrybloch.com, Many Happy Returns, Thomas M. Bloch, 2010. ^ Hoffer, William (1987).

It also provides leasing and product support services. Boeing is among the largest global aircraft manufacturers, is the second-largest defense contractor in the world based on 2013 revenue, Boeing is organized into five primary divisions: Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA); Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS); Engineering, Operations &amp; Technology; Boeing Capital; and Boeing Shared Services Group. In 2014, Boeing recorded $90.78 billion in sales, ranked 27th on the Fortune magazine ""Fortune 500"" list (2015), ranked 90th on the ""Fortune Global 500"" list (2015), and ranked 27th on the ""World's Most Admired Companies"" list (2015). William Boeing founded his company a few months after the June 15 maiden flight of one of the two ""B&amp;W"" seaplanes built with the assistance of George Conrad Westervelt, a U.S. Navy engineer. Boeing and Westervelt decided to build the B&amp;W seaplane after having flown in a Curtiss aircraft. Boeing bought a Glenn Martin ""Flying Birdcage"" seaplane (so called because of all the guy-wires holding it together) and was taught to fly by Glenn Martin himself. Boeing soon crashed the Birdcage and when Martin informed Boeing that replacement parts would not become available for months, Boeing realized he could build his own plane in that amount of time. He and his friend Cdr. G.C. Westervelt agreed to build a better airplane and soon produced the B&amp;W Seaplane. Work began in 1936 on Boeing Plant 2 to accommodate the production of larger modern aircraft. Boeing B-29 assembly line in Wichita, Kansas (1944) Boeing 377 Stratocruiser Shortly after, an agreement with Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) was reached, to develop and build a commercial flying boat able to carry passengers on transoceanic routes. The first flight of the Boeing 314 Clipper was in June 1938. It was the largest civil aircraft of its time, with a capacity of 90 passengers on day flights, and of 40 passengers on night flights. One year later, the first regular passenger service from the U.S. to the UK was inaugurated. Subsequently other routes were opened, so that soon Pan Am flew with the Boeing 314 to destinations all over the world. In 1938, Boeing completed work on its Model 307 Stratoliner. This was the world's first pressurized-cabin transport aircraft, and it was capable of cruising at an altitude of 20,000 feet (6,100&#160;m) – above most weather disturbances. It was based on the B-17, using the same wings, tail and engines. During World War II, Boeing built a large number of B-17 and B-29 bombers. Boeing ranked twelfth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. The company aimed to recover quickly by selling its Stratocruiser (the Model 377), a luxurious four-engine commercial airliner developed from the B-29. However, sales of this model were not as expected and Boeing had to seek other opportunities to overcome the situation. The Boeing 707 in British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) livery, 1964 Boeing developed military jets such as the B-47 Stratojet The 707 and 747 formed the backbone of many major airline fleets through the end of the 1970s, including United (747 on this picture) and Pan Am (707 on this picture) Lufthansa Boeing 727. A Boeing 737, the best-selling aircraft. Vertol Aircraft Corporation was acquired by Boeing in 1960, Several versions have been developed, mainly to increase seating capacity and range. The 737 remains in production as of 2016. The roll-out ceremonies for the first 747–100 took place in 1968, at the massive new factory in Everett, about an hour's drive from Boeing's Seattle home. The aircraft made its first flight a year later. The first commercial flight occurred in 1970. The 747 has an intercontinental range and a larger seating capacity than Boeing's previous aircraft. Boeing also developed hydrofoils in the 1960s. The screw-driven USS High Point (PCH-1) was an experimental submarine hunter. The patrol hydrofoil USS Tucumcari (PGH-2) was more successful. Only one was built, but it saw service in Vietnam and Europe before running aground in 1972. Its waterjet and fully submersed flying foils were the example for the later Pegasus-class patrol hydrofoils and the Model 929 Jetfoil ferries in the 1980s. The Tucumcari and later boats were produced in Renton. While the Navy hydrofoils were withdrawn from service in the late 1980s, the Boeing Jetfoils are still in service in Asia. 1970s In April 1994, Boeing introduced the most modern commercial jet aircraft at the time, the twin-engine 777, with a seating capacity of approximately 300 to 370 passengers in a typical three-class layout, in between the 767 and the 747. The longest range twin-engined aircraft in the world, the 777 was the first Boeing airliner to feature a ""fly-by-wire"" system and was conceived partly in response to the inroads being made by the European Airbus into Boeing's traditional market. This aircraft reached an important milestone by being the first airliner to be designed entirely by using computer-aided design (CAD) techniques. On August 2, 2005, Boeing sold its Rocketdyne rocket engine division to Pratt &amp; Whitney. On May 1, 2006, Boeing agreed to purchase Dallas, Texas-based Aviall, Inc. for $1.7&#160;billion and retain $350&#160;million in debt. Aviall, Inc. and its subsidiaries, Aviall Services, Inc. and ILS formed a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing Commercial Aviation Services (BCAS). The stage, based on both Apollo-Saturn and Space Shuttle technologies, was to be constructed at NASA's Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans; Boeing constructed the S-IC stage of the Saturn V rocket at this site in the 1960s. The Boeing 787 Dreamliner on its first flight Boeing launched the 777 Freighter in May 2005 with an order from Air France. The freighter variant is based on the −200LR. Other customers include FedEx and Emirates. Boeing officially announced in November 2005 that it would produce a larger variant of the 747, the 747-8, in two versions, commencing with the Freighter version with firm orders for two cargo carriers. The second version, named the Intercontinental, is for passenger airlines. Both 747-8 versions feature a lengthened fuselage, new, advanced engines and wings, and the incorporation of other technologies developed for the 787. Boeing also received the launch contract from the U.S. Navy for the P-8 Poseidon Multimission Maritime Aircraft, an anti-submarine warfare patrol aircraft. It has also received orders for the 737 AEW&amp;C ""Wedgetail"" aircraft. The company has also introduced new extended range versions of the 737. These include the 737-700ER and 737-900ER. The 737-900ER is the latest and will extend the range of the 737–900 to a similar range as the successful 737–800 with the capability to fly more passengers, due to the addition of two extra emergency exits. The record-breaking 777-200LR Worldliner, presented at the Paris Air Show 2005. The 777-200LR Worldliner embarked on a well-received global demonstration tour in the second half of 2005, showing off its capacity to fly farther than any other commercial aircraft. On November 10, 2005, the 777-200LR set a world record for the longest non-stop flight. The plane, which departed from Hong Kong traveling to London, took a longer route, which included flying over the U.S. It flew 11,664 nautical miles (21,601&#160;km) during its 22-hour 42-minute flight. It was flown by Pakistan International Airlines pilots and PIA was the first airline to fly the 777-200LR Worldliner. On August 11, 2006, Boeing agreed to form a joint-venture with the large Russian titanium producer, VSMPO-Avisma for the machining of titanium forgings. The forgings will be used on the 787 program. The KC-46 tankers are based on the KC-767. Graphic representation of the XM1202 Mounted Combat System vehicle Boeing jointly with Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), were the prime contractors in the U.S. military's Future Combat Systems program. In May 2003, the U.S. Air Force announced it would lease 100 KC-767 tankers to replace the oldest 136 of its KC-135s. In November 2003, responding to critics who argued that the lease was more expensive than an outright purchase, the DoD announced a revised lease of 20 aircraft and purchase of 80. In December 2003, the Pentagon announced the project was to be frozen while an investigation of allegations of corruption by one of its former procurement staffers, Darleen Druyun (who began employment at Boeing in January) was begun. The fallout of this resulted in the resignation of Boeing CEO Philip M. Condit and the termination of CFO Michael M. Sears. James A. Bell served as interim CEO (in addition to his normal duties as Boeing's CFO) until the appointment of Jim McNerney as the new Chairman, President, and CEO on June 30, 2005. Industrial espionage In June 2003, Lockheed Martin sued Boeing, alleging that the company had resorted to industrial espionage in 1998 to win the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) competition. Lockheed Martin claimed that the former employee Kenneth Branch, who went to work for McDonnell Douglas and Boeing, passed nearly 30,000 pages of proprietary documents to his new employers. Lockheed Martin argued that these documents allowed Boeing to win 19 of the 28 tendered military satellite launches. Until the late 1970s, the U.S. had a near monopoly in the Large Civil Aircraft (LCA) sector. The Airbus consortium (created in 1969) started competing effectively in the 1980s. At that stage the U.S. became concerned about the European competition and the alleged subsidies paid by the European governments for the developments of the early models of the Airbus family. This became a major issue of contention, as the European side was equally concerned by subsidies accruing to U.S. LCA manufacturers through NASA and Defense programs. The EU and the U.S. started bilateral negotiations for the limitation of government subsidies to the LCA sector in the late 1980s. Negotiations were concluded in 1992 with the signing of the EC-US Agreement on Trade in Large Civil Aircraft which imposes disciplines on government support on both sides of the Atlantic which are significantly stricter than the relevant World Trade Organization (WTO) rules: Notably, the Agreement regulates in detail the forms and limits of government support, prescribes transparency obligations and commits the parties to avoiding trade disputes. Boeing's Wichita plant in 2010. Boeing ended its presence in Kansas in 2012-13. In 2010, Boeing completed its acquisition of Argon ST Inc. Based in Fairfax, Virginia, Argon ST develops C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) and combat systems. On June 30, 2010, Boeing announced its intent to acquire Argon ST as part of the company's strategy to expand its capabilities to address the C4ISR, cyber and intelligence markets. Boeing announced on May 13, 2013 it would cut 1,500 IT jobs in Seattle, Washington over the next three years in combination of layoffs, attrition and relocation. Most of those will be relocated (approximately 600 jobs each) to St. Louis, Missouri, and North Charleston, South Carolina. Boeing was also joining other aviation-related members in the Algal Biomass Organization (ABO) on June 2008.

Bristol-Myers_Squibb," ""Squibb"" redirects here. It is not to be confused with Squib (disambiguation). Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Type Public company Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;BMY S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Pharmaceuticals Founded 1887 Headquarters 345 Park Avenue New York City, United States Key people Dr. Giovanni Caforio, CEO Revenue US$18.8 Billion (FY 2009) Operating income US$5.34 Billion (FY 2009) Net income US$10.6 Billion (FY 2009) Total assets US$31.0 Billion (FY 2009) Total equity US$14.8 Billion (FY 2009) Number of employees 28,000 (2010) Website www.bms.com A Bristol-Myers Squibb R&amp;D facility Lawrenceville Rd, Lawrence Township, United States Bristol-Myers Squibb, often referred to as BMS, is an American pharmaceutical company, headquartered in New York City. Bristol-Myers Squibb manufactures prescription pharmaceuticals in several therapeutic areas, including cancer, HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and psychiatric disorders. Its mission is to ""discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases."" BMS' primary R&amp;D sites are located in Lawrence Township (formerly Squibb, near Princeton) and Wallingford, Connecticut (formerly Bristol-Myers), with other sites in Hopewell and New Brunswick, New Jersey, and in Swords, Ireland, Braine-l'Alleud, Belgium, Tokyo, Japan and Bangalore, India. Squibb was founded in 1858 by Edward Robinson Squibb in Brooklyn, New York. Squibb was known as a vigorous advocate of quality control and high purity standards within the fledgling pharmaceutical industry of his time, at one point self-publishing an alternative to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (Squibb's Ephemeris of Materia Medica) after failing to convince the American Medical Association to incorporate higher purity standards. Mentions of the Materia Medica, Squibb products, and Edward Squibb's opinion on the utility and best method of preparation for various medicants are found in many medical papers of the late 1800s. Squibb Corporation served as a major supplier of medical goods to the Union Army during the United States Civil War, providing portable medical kits containing morphine, surgical anesthetics, and quinine for the treatment of malaria (which was endemic in most of the eastern United States at that time). The Bristol-Myers-Squibb Company was formed in 1989, following the merger of its predecessors Bristol-Myers and the Squibb Corporation. Bristol-Myers was founded in 1887 by William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers in Clinton, New York (both were graduates of Hamilton College). In 1999, President Clinton awarded Bristol-Myers Squibb the National Medal of Technology, the nation's highest recognition for technological achievement, ""for extending and enhancing human life through innovative pharmaceutical research and development and for redefining the science of clinical study through groundbreaking and hugely complex clinical trials that are recognized models in the industry."" The company was involved in an accounting scandal in 2002 that resulted in a significant restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. The restatement was the result of an improper booking of sales related to ""channel stuffing"", or the practice of offering excess inventory to customers to create higher sales numbers. The company has since settled with the United States Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing to pay $150 million while neither admitting nor denying guilt. In November, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it was ""splitting off"" Mead Johnson Nutrition by offering BMY shareholders the opportunity to exchange their stock for shares in Mead Johnson. According to Bristol-Myers Squibb, this move was expected to further sharpen the company's focus on biopharmaceuticals. BMS is a Fortune 500 Company (#114 in 2010 list). Newsweek's 2009 Green Ranking recognized Bristol-Myers Squibb as 8th among 500 of the largest United States corporations. Also, BMS was included in the 2009 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index of leading sustainability-driven companies. 2010 On June 29, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMS) extend its portfolio of diabetes treatments when it agreed to buy Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc for around $5.3 billion in cash and will pay $1.7 billion to Eli Lilly to cover Amylin's debt and its obligations to Eli Lilly from ending the collaboration with Amylin. Astra Zeneca, who already collaborates on several diabetes treatments with BMS, will pay $3.4 billion in cash for the rights to develop Amylin's products. In December the company received FDA approval for the use of the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo) in treating patients whose skin cancer cannot be removed or have not responded to previous drug therapies.

CA for short, is an American, multinational, publicly held company headquartered in New York, New York. The company creates systems software (and previously applications software) that runs in mainframe, distributed computing, virtual machine and cloud computing environments. Although the company once sold anti-virus and Internet security commercial software programs for personal computers during its venture into the business-to-consumer (""B2C"") market, it remains primarily known for its business-to-business (""B2B"") mainframe and distributed (client/server, etc.) information technology (""IT"") infrastructure applications since the spin off of their security products into Total Defense. CA Technologies posted $4.4 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2014 (ending March 31, 2014) The company employs approximately 12,700 people (March 31, 2014).

(July 2013) Inception and early years Under regulatory pressure in 1969, IBM announced its decision to unbundle the sale of computer hardware from its software and support services; i.e., mainframe computers from computer programs, etc. (At this time, the computer industry was dominated by mainframes and their related operating systems, principally from IBM.) The decision opened new markets to competition and provided an opportunity for entrepreneurs to enter the nascent software industry&#160;— an opportunity Charles Wang along with his friend and business partner Russ Artzt exploited by creating a company to develop and sell IBM mainframe software, so they developed several products for that market with modest success. In 1976, they obtained exclusive, North American distribution rights for CA-Sort, a sort/merge/copy and data management utility software program that helps mainframe computers manipulate data efficiently. The sorting product had previously been distributed by independent software vendor (""ISV"") Pansophic Systems under the name PanSort. CA-Sort was originally developed by a Swiss ISV named Computer Associates, founded by Sam Goodner and Max Sevcik several years earlier. The product had found success in Europe, but sales in North America hadn't kept pace. Wang and Artzt established a new venture (in partnership with the Swiss company), which they named Trans-American Computer Associates and went to market with CA-Sort, along with their original products. CA-SORT's sorting algorithms and the product's performance (mostly on the DOS/VS computing platform), combined with modest pricing and the sales acumen of Charles Wang, led to rapid growth in the large and lucrative North American market. Helping fuel that growth was CA's entry to the DOS/VS enterprise storage management market with software products CA-Dynam/T (tape management system), CA-Dynam/D (disk or ""DASD"" (direct-access storage device) management) and CA-Dynam/FI (dynamic file independence). Another useful tool that brought OS/MVS sophistication to DOS/VS(E) environments was CA-Driver, a Job Control Language (JCL) management product. CA-Sort's primary competitors were Syncsort from Whitlow Computer Systems, plus DFSORT and SM-023 from IBM. ""Synergy"" among CA's products became the consistent theme that brought competitive advantage and laid the foundation for the Unicenter concept years later. 1980s Throughout the decade, the company grew rapidly via several strategic, sometimes surprising acquisitions: CGA Computer's Top Secret product, plus software makers Capex Corporation, Johnson Systems (flagship product JARS), Value Software (flagship product DISPATCH) and Uccel Corporation among them. In recognition of his success in 1983, Charles Wang was given a ""Software CEO of the Year"" award. In May 1985, CA-Unicenter was introduced as an integrated collection of many of its recently acquired, mainframe systems products. Its sales (often ""wrap &amp; roll"" financial deals) helped bring CA enough revenue and market share, especially from existing customers converting from DOS/VSE (z/VSE today) to OS/MVS (z/OS today), that CA was eventually able to acquire its archrival, UCCEL Corporation, in 1987. Ownership of those industry-standard, flagship products (UCC-1, UCC-7, UCC-11, plus ACF2) made CA the largest independent vendor of mainframe infrastructure software and dominant vendor of OS/MVS security software with CA-Top Secret (#2 market share) and CA-ACF2 (#1 market share). IBM's Resource Access Control Facility (RACF) product held the #3 market share position. UCCEL's acquisition also made Walter Haefner, that company's half-owner at the time, CA's largest individual shareholder—a distinction he enjoyed until his death in June 2012. Whereas CA's historical focus had been on system utilities including those for the VM/CMS (z/VM today) mainframe platform, the company also sought via its 1986 acquisition of Software International to compete in the applications arena against Dun &amp; Bradstreet's former market leaders Management Science America (MSA) and McCormack &amp; Dodge (M&amp;D). CA also competed against Microsoft and Lotus Development Corporation through the acquisition of companies such as Information Unlimited Software that provided spreadsheet, word processor, graphics and other applications. In addition to its existing CA-Universe database management system (""DBMS"") product, CA acquired independent software vendors Applied Data Research (ADR) in 1988 and Cullinet in 1989. Both companies were struggling against IBM and its DB2 product offering. In 1987, CA's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange using the ticker symbol ""CA"" following its time (1981–1987) on the NASDAQ using the stock symbol ""CASI"". As the decade ended, CA became the first software company after Microsoft to exceed $1 billion in sales. 1990s Early in the decade, CA was forced to address criticism of the company (lack of strategic focus, incompatibilities among its disparate product lines, a reputation for poor customer service, plus failure to win a significant share in application software and database management system markets) as well as a sharp decline in its stock price, which fell more than 50% during 1990. The ensuing changes included a push into foreign markets (Japan, Canada, Africa, Latin America), reform in how the company charged its customers for software maintenance, and improved compatibility with products from other vendors such as Hewlett-Packard (HP), Apple Computer, and Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). In 1994, CA acquired the ASK Group (which had acquired Ingres Corporation in 1990) and continued to offer the Ingres database management system under a variety of brand names (for example, OpenIngres, Ingres II, or Advantage Ingres). CA became the target of several competitors' aggressive ""rip &amp; replace"" sales campaigns, often led by ex-CA employees motivated by revenge. Meanwhile, CA continued its expansion through acquisitions (including many of those competitors), most notably in client/server computing (Legent Corporation for $1.78 billion in 1995, at that time the biggest-ever acquisition in the software industry) and data storage software (Cheyenne Software for $1.2 billion in 1996). CA again laid claim to the software industry's then-largest acquisition ($3.5 billion) via Platinum Technology International in 1999. As part of that acquisition, CA obtained the AutoSys distributed systems (vs. mainframe) job scheduler, which Platinum had acquired in 1995. Shortly after its acquisition of Platinum, in order to avoid antitrust problems, CA had to divest itself of certain mainframe products, owning at least six batch processing schedulers. The divestiture was primarily of the Z/Team products (Zeke job scheduler, etc.) originally from Altai, Inc., also acquired by Platinum in 1995. CA had previously initiated a lawsuit against Altai, claiming copyright infringement and trade secret misappropriation (Computer Associates Int'l, Inc. v. Altai Inc.) after discovering in the late 1980s that CA's System Adapter code was in Altai's OSCAR software module. ASG Software Solutions eventually took ownership of those former Altai products. Following CA's acquisition of Uccel in 1987, many of CA's customers felt trapped, considering the company's dominance in mainframe security software, tape management and batch job scheduling. That sense of vendor lock-in was exacerbated when mainframe databases DATACOM/DB (from ADR) and IDMS (from Cullinet) were acquired by CA in the very late '80s. Many of CA's customers went ""running into the arms"" of IBM following IBM's 1996 acquisition of Tivoli Software. IBM's RACF security software gained significant market share and DB2 replaced much of CA's database clientele as did Oracle (mostly non-mainframe). CA's 1999 acquisition of Platinum Technology came as a shock, especially since Platinum unabashedly claimed in its sales campaign against smaller ISVs (like New Dimension Software and its technically superior CONTROL-M job scheduler) that those competitors could easily be swallowed by CA and that ""Platinum would never be acquired by CA"". The main reason for defections from CA wasn't that its software was bad, but that its behavior as a vendor was. Those experiences left customers with a bitter taste for ISVs and has since allowed IBM to portray all ISVs as potential extortionists. CA's stock price (in 2012 dollars) spanned a range from a low of $1.38 in September 1990 to just over $70 in December 1999. 2000s During this time, the company presented its Enterprise IT Management (EITM) vision to unify and simplify enterprise-wide IT In July 7, 2014, CA Technologies announced it entered into a definitive agreement to divest its CA arcserve data protection business (arcserve) to Marlin Equity Partners (Marlin). CA has been party to a number of lawsuits over its almost forty-year history, and particularly so during the period from the early 1990s to early 2000s. One of the higher-profile disputes was a 1992 suit by Electronic Data Systems (EDS), which was a CA customer. EDS accused CA of breach of contract, including misuse of copyright, and violations of anti-trust laws. CA filed a counter-claim, also alleging breach of contract, including copyright infringement and misappropriation of trade secrets. Meanwhile, a hostile (and unsuccessful) takeover bid by CA in 1998 for computer consulting firm Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) prompted a bribery suit by CSC’s (then) chairman Van Honeycutt against CA’s founder and (then) CEO, Charles Wang.) occurred while the company faced a slowdown in European markets and an economic slump in Asia, both of which had affected CA's earnings and stock price. In total, the company took a $675 million after-tax charge for $1.1 billion in payouts to Wang and other top CA executives. An investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also followed, which resulted in charges against the company and some of its former top executives.

Cablevision also offers high-speed Internet connections (Optimum Online), digital cable (Optimum TV), and VoIP (Optimum Voice) phone service (the eighth-largest telephone provider in the U.S.) Cablevision Call Center in Newark Optimum Online Optimum Voice is a VoIP (Voice over IP) telephone services provided by Cablevision for its Optimum Online customers. Customers must have Optimum Online first before using Optimum Voice as it uses the Internet (VoIP) for the phone session. Optimum TV, formerly iO digital cable, is a digital cable service offered by Cablevision, available in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and parts of Pennsylvania. It includes 130 HDTV channels, interactive channels, such as games, and channels that allow viewers to browse listings of autos and homes for sale in the area, and video on demand. HD channels are free with Optimum TV to customers who subscribe to the service package that includes the SD channel. Additionally, Optimum TV comes with 46 channels of Music Choice music channels. Optimum TV also offers a DVR and an HD-DVR, for an additional cost. It was the first American company to offer BBC World News (formerly BBC World). For years, Cablevision was one of the few providers not carrying BBC America until they finally added the channel on August 25, 2011. Other properties In the mid-1960s, Charles Dolan built a cable system called Sterling Manhattan Cable in the borough of Manhattan and launched Home Box Office (HBO). He ended up selling both the cable system and HBO to Time Life Inc. He used the money to start a new cable system in suburban Long Island called Cablevision. Cablevision quickly expanded and built system throughout the New York metro area: the other boroughs of New York City, New Jersey, Westchester County, and Connecticut. In the 1980s, Cablevision also expanded into the Chicago, Boston, and Cleveland areas. By the mid-1990s Cablevision would offer service to 2.9 million subscribers in 19 states. Through a series of transactions in the late 1990s, Cablevision decided to consolidate their cable systems into three core areas: New York, Cleveland, and Boston. Despite reducing the number of areas served they were able to bring the number of subscribers to 3.5 million through these transactions. One major transaction made at this time was with Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI). Cablevision gained 10 New York area cable systems from TCI and in exchange TCI gained 33% ownership in the company. In 1999, AT&amp;T Corporation took over TCI thus giving them the one-third ownership in Cablevision. Bresnan provides service to about 308,000 cable subscribers in Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming. This is the first time in a decade that Cablevision has owned systems outside of the New York area (although Bresnan, like Cablevision, had its headquarters in the New York City suburbs). In May 2011, Cablevision rebranded the Bresnan systems as Optimum West. On February 8, 2013, Cablevision reached an agreement to sell its Optimum West systems to Charter Communications for US$1.63 billion. From September 1988 through July 1989, Cablevision did not carry MSG Network (at the time owned by Gulf+Western, which later became Paramount Communications) over the question of whether MSG should be offered as a basic service or a premium service. This move also occurred as New York Yankees games on cable moved to MSG from Cablevision-owned SportsChannel.) before it carries NFL Network. This has been criticized by New Jersey legislators. Recently however, Cablevision purchased Bresnan Communications, a company headquartered in Purchase, New York, but which did all of its business in the Rocky Mountain region. Because of this, the NFL Network is carried on the former Bresnan (now Optimum West) systems, but not on Optimum systems in Greater New York. Finally, on August 16, 2012, Cablevision announced that they have reached an agreement with the NFL to carry the network on all its systems effective August 17. On March 2, 2010, WABC-TV in New York along with Philadelphia sister station WPVI (carried in Mercer, Monmouth and Ocean counties) stated that they would pull their programming from Cablevision on March 7, 2010 (at midnight), unless a new payment structure is implemented for its network programming. Cablevision responded by citing WABC-TV and WPVI's free, over-the-air accessibility. Cablevision spokesman Charles Scheuler stated ""It is not fair for ABC-Disney to hold Cablevision customers hostage by forcing them to pay what amounts to a new TV tax."" Cablevision's contract with News Corp to carry FOX (including MyNetwork TV) expired on October 15, 2010. The contract includes WNYW and WWOR-TV in New York and WTXF in Philadelphia. The contract also includes the cable networks National Geographic Wild, Fox Business, and Fox Deportes (formerly Fox Sports en Español). Programming affected by the dispute includes the coverage of the NFL on Fox, 2010 National League Championship Series, part of the 2010 World Series, and popular shows like American Idol and Glee. On October 16, 2010 at 12:01&#160;am, Fox pulled all of their networks involved in the dispute from Cablevision subscribers. The removed stations included WPIX (New York), which is carried on most Cablevision systems, WPHL (Philadelphia) on Central Jersey systems in Mercer, Monmouth and Ocean Counties, WCCT (Hartford, CT) on some Connecticut systems, and KWGN (Denver) on Optimum West systems in Colorado and Wyoming. WTIC-TV and WGN America were initially not included in this dispute, but on August 24, Tribune pulled WTIC in Connecticut and WGN from Cablevision's Connecticut and Optimum West systems. Like the dispute with Time Warner Cable and Hearst Television, these channels were replaced with other cable offerings. In a statement, Cablevision said that ""The bankrupt Tribune Co. and the hedge funds and banks that own it, including Oaktree Capital Management, Angelo Gordon &amp; Co. and others, are trying to solve Tribune's financial problems on the backs of Cablevision customers. Tribune and their hedge fund owners are demanding tens of millions in new fees for WPIX and other stations they own. They should stop their anti-consumer demands and work productively to reach an agreement."" In 1994, Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western), the owner of Madison Square Garden, was acquired by Viacom, who in turn sold the MSG properties to Cablevision and ITT Corporation, which had 50% ownership each. ITT would sell its share to Cablevision three years later. On February 9, 2010 Cablevision spun off its subsidiary Madison Square Garden, L.P. into a new company named The Madison Square Garden Company. Although a separate company, James Dolan is the chairman and remains an important figure in both companies. The company has three division consisting of professional sports teams, two regional sports networks, and several entertainment venues. MSG, controls its namesake Madison Square Garden arena in New York City, and the professional sports teams that play there: the New York Knicks, New York Rangers, and New York Liberty. The same company also owns the Hartford Wolf Pack, a minor-league professional hockey team affiliated with the Rangers. MSG. also holds the TV rights for the Knicks, Rangers, Liberty, New York Islanders, New Jersey Devils, Buffalo Sabres and New York Red Bulls through their cable channels MSG Network and MSG Plus (formerly FSN New York). Cablevision previously had the rights to the New York Yankees, New Jersey Nets and New York Mets, who left to start their own channels. Cablevision also previously attempted to purchase the Yankees, The Theatre at Madison Square Garden (formerly known as Felt Forum, Paramount and WaMu Theatre), and a long-term lease to operate Radio City Music Hall. AMC Networks Rainbow Media also controlled Fuse TV until 2010, when ownership was transferred to Cablevision's Madison Square Garden division, now operating independently as Madison Square Garden, Inc. (see above). The Rainbow Media subsidiary of Cablevision also operated a satellite television company called Voom, which was shut down on April 30, 2005, but lived on as a series of high-definition television channels named Voom HD Networks. They were available on Cablevision and iO digital cable until January 21, 2009. However, the 15 U.S. channels were eventually also shut down due to lack of distribution prior to the spinning off of Rainbow Media from Cablevision as the independent AMC Networks.

The Campbell Soup Company, also known as Campbell's, is an American producer of canned soups and related products. Campbell's products are sold in 120 countries around the world. It is headquartered In addition to collectible advertising, the company has also had notable commercial sponsorships. Among these was Orson Welles's The Campbell Playhouse, which had previously been The Mercury Theatre on the Air. After the program's adaptation of The War of the Worlds became a sensation for accidentally starting a mass panic due to its realism, Campbell's took over as sponsor of the radio theater program in December 1938. In the UK and Ireland, Campbell Soup was rebranded as Batchelors Condensed Soup (UK) and Erin (Ireland) in March 2008, when the license to use the brand name expired. Premier Foods, St. Albans, Hertfordshire bought the Campbell Soup Company in the UK and Ireland, for £450m ($830m) in 2006, but was licensed to use the brand only until 2008. Under this agreement, the US-based Campbell Soup Company will continue to produce Campbell's Condensed Soup but cannot sell the product in the UK for a further 5 years. in the city. In January 2010, Campbell's Canadian subsidiary began selling a line of soups that are certified by the Islamic Society of North America as being halal (prepared in accordance with Islamic law). Although Campbell does not have any plans to sell its halal soups in the United States, the move has drawn criticism from anti-Muslim critics in the United States. Blogger Pamela Geller called for a boycott of the company. In 1962, artist Andy Warhol took the familiar look of the Campbell's soup can and integrated it into a series of pop art silkscreens, a theme he would return to off and on through the 1960s and 1970s. The first batch in 1962 were a series of 32 canvases. At first, the cans were accurate representations of actual Campbell's cans, but as his series progressed, they became more surrealistic, with Warhol experimenting with negative-reversed color schemes and other varied techniques (many of these which would be used on other Warhol paintings of the period, such as his celebrity silkscreens of the 1960s). The silkscreens themselves have become iconic pieces of pop art, with one in particular, Small Torn Campbell Soup Can (Pepper Pot) (1962), commanding a price of $11.8 million at auction in 2006. In 2004, Campbell's themselves recognized Warhol's art by releasing in the eastern United States a limited-edition series of cans that were inspired by the coloring and silkscreen effects of Warhol's pieces. This marked one of the few times in the company's history that they would change the trade dress for their main canned-soup line in any substantial manner. In 2012, the Warhol-inspired cans returned to shelves, in an exclusive retail partnership with Target.

Benjamin Holt attempted to fix the problem by increasing the size and width of the wheels up to 7.5 feet (2.3&#160;m) tall and 6 feet (1.8&#160;m) wide, producing a tractor 46 feet (14&#160;m) wide. But this also made the tractors increasingly complex, expensive and difficult to maintain. Another solution considered was to lay a temporary plank road ahead of the steam tractor, but this was time-consuming, expensive, and interfered with earthmoving. Holt thought of wrapping the planks around the wheels. He replaced the wheels on a 40 horsepower (30&#160;kW) Holt steamer, No. 77, with a set of wooden tracks bolted to chains. On Thanksgiving Day, November 24, 1904, he successfully tested the updated machine plowing the soggy delta land of Roberts Island. Some sources, though, attribute this name to British soldiers in July 1907. Two years later Holt sold his first steam-powered tractor crawlers for US$5,500, about US$128,000 today. Each side featured a track frame measured 30 inches (760&#160;mm) high by 42 inches (1,100&#160;mm) wide and were 9 feet (2.7&#160;m) long. The tracks were 3 inches (76&#160;mm) by 4 inches (100&#160;mm) redwood slats. Holt received the first patent for a practical continuous track for use with a tractor on December 7, 1907 for his improved ""Traction Engine"" (""improvement in vehicles, and especially of the traction engine class; and included endless traveling platform supports upon which the engine is carried""). Caterpillar company formed (1925) CAT 323DL Caterpillar built its first Russian facility in the town of Tosno, located near St. Petersburg, Russia. It was completed in 16 months and occupied in November 1999. It had the first electrical substation built in the Leningrad Oblast since the Communist government was dissolved on December 26, 1991. The facility was built under harsh winter conditions, where the temperature was below −13&#160;°F (−25&#160;°C). The facility construction was managed by the Lemminkäinen Group located in Helsinki, Finland. In addition to increasing sales of its core products, much of Caterpillar's growth has been through acquisitions, including: Sortable table Company or Asset Acquired Location Date Acquired From Products Notes Trackson Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States 1951 Traxcavators (tracked loaders) and pipelayers ""Traxcavator"" became a Cat brand Towmotor Corporation Mentor, Ohio, United States 1965 Blount International, Inc.

The president and chief executive of the company is Leslie Moonves. Sumner Redstone, owner of National Amusements, is CBS's majority shareholder and serves as executive chairman. The company began trading on the NYSE on January 3, 2006. Until then, the corporation was known as Viacom, and is the legal successor to said company. A new company, keeping the Viacom name, was spun off from CBS. CBS, not Viacom, retains control of over-the-air television (CBS, CW) and radio broadcasting, TV production and distribution, publishing, pay-cable, basic cable (Pop), and recording formerly owned by the larger company. CBS has its headquarters in CBS Building, Midtown, Manhattan, New York City, United States. Main article: Viacom (original) Viacom was created in 1970 as the television syndication division of CBS, and was spun off in 1971. However, in 1999, Viacom acquired its former parent, by this time also named CBS Corporation, formerly Westinghouse Electric. The prior CBS Corporation also owned CMT and The Nashville Network (now Spike), which remained Viacom properties after the 2005 split, but the prior CBS did not own UPN, Showtime, Paramount Television, Paramount Parks, or Simon and Schuster. In March 2005, Viacom announced plans of looking into splitting the company into two publicly traded companies, amid issues of the stock price stagnating (although it was alleged that another main force behind the split was the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy, which led to MTV not being allowed to produce any more halftime shows, they had also produced the show for Super Bowl XXXV, the first Super Bowl CBS aired since regaining NFL rights and becoming MTV's corporate sibling). Old separate Viacom logo (1990-2005). On June 14, 2005, the Viacom board of directors approved the split of the company into two firms. The CBS Corporation name would be revived for one of the companies, to be headed by longtime television executive (and Viacom co-President) Leslie Moonves, and would include CBS, UPN, Infinity Broadcasting, Viacom Outdoor, Showtime Networks, and Paramount's television studio. The split was structured such that the ""new"" Viacom was spun off from the ""old"" Viacom, which was renamed CBS Corporation. In a sense, this was a repeat of the 1971 spinoff. However, in this case, CBS retained virtually all of the prior firm's broadcast TV assets, including its various syndication companies. With the split, the two new companies began trading on the NYSE on January 3, 2006. Investors anticipated Viacom benefiting from the split, but instead, it dropped approximately 20 percent, while CBS rose 9 percent. Viacom/CBS has announced it would sell several non-duopoly UPN affiliates, in Indianapolis, Columbus, New Orleans, and Oklahoma City, with possibilities of additional sales. CBS announced on November 3, 2005, that it would acquire College Sports TV (now CBS Sports Network) for US$325 million. CEO of CSTV Brian Bedol will continue to run that network and report to Leslie Moonves, chairman of CBS. The transaction was completed in January 2006. 2006 Main article: The CW The CW logo On January 24, 2006, CBS Corporation, and Warner Bros. announced that they were to create a new broadcast network, The CW Television Network. The network officially debuted on September 18, 2006. The network formally debuted on September 20 with the 2 hour premiere of America's Next Top Model. The network is the result of a merger of The WB (a Warner Brothers holding) and UPN (a CBS Corporation holding). CBS Corporation and Time Warner each own 50% of the network. Tribune Broadcasting (which previously owned a 25% stake on The WB) and CBS Corporation will contribute its stations as new network affiliates.

It is incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Summit, New Jersey. The company's major products are Thalomid (thalidomide), which is approved for the acute treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum (""ENL""), as well as in combination with dexamethasone for patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, and Revlimid (lenalidomide), for which the company has received FDA and EMA approval in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy. Revlimid is also approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent anemia due to Low- or Intermediate-1-risk Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Both Thalomid and Revlimid are sold through proprietary risk-management distribution programs to ensure safe and appropriate use of these pharmaceuticals. Vidaza is approved for the treatment of patients with MDS. Celgene also receives royalties from Novartis Pharma AG on sales of the entire Ritalin family of drugs, which are widely used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories sought the material for bioequivalency studies required to bring its own, generic, version of thalidomide to market. In response to the refusal, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories filed a Citizen's Petition with the FDA asking the Agency to adopt procedures that would ensure generic applicants the right to buy sufficient samples to perform bioequivalence testing of drugs that were subject to REMS distribution restrictions. Celgene denied that it had behaved anticompetitively, arguing that the legislative history strongly suggested that Congress considered and rejected a proposed guaranteed access procedure like the one proposed by Dr. Reddy’s. Celgene further argued that requiring innovator companies to sell their products to potential generic competitors would violate its intellectual property rights and subject it to liability risks in the event that patients were harmed in Dr. Reddy's studies. Generic manufacturer Lannett Company initiated antitrust litigation that accused Celgene of using its REMS for THALOMID® (thalidomide) to violate the anti-monopolization provisions of the Sherman Act. In early 2011, the district court denied Celgene’s motion to dismiss. The case was set for trial beginning in February 2012, but the parties settled before the trial began, thereby postponing further judicial review of antitrust claims premised on alleged abuse of REMS distribution restrictions."

One of the successor companies of Standard Oil, it is headquartered in San Ramon, California, and active in more than 180 countries. Chevron is engaged in every aspect of the oil, natural gas, and geothermal energy industries, including hydrocarbon exploration and production; refining, marketing and transport; chemicals manufacturing and sales; and power generation. Chevron is one of the world's largest oil companies; as of 2014 It was also one of the Seven Sisters that dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s. Chevron's downstream operations manufacture and sell products such as fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals. The company's most significant areas of operations are the west coast of North America, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Southeast Asia, South Korea, Australia and South Africa. In 2010, Chevron sold an average 3.1 million barrels per day (490×103 m3/d) of refined products like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Chevron's alternative energy operations include geothermal, solar, wind power, biofuel, fuel cells, and hydrogen. In 2011–2013, the company planned to spend at least $2&#160;billion on research and acquisition of renewable power ventures. Chevron has claimed to be the world's largest producer of geothermal energy. In October 2011, Chevron launched a 29-MW thermal solar-to-steam facility in the Coalinga Field to produce the steam for enhanced oil recovery. The project is the largest of its kind in the world.

A Chevron station branded as ""Standard"" in Las Vegas In 1911, Standard Oil Co. (California) was severed from its parent corporation, Standard Oil, as a result of the federal government's successful lawsuit against Standard Oil under the Sherman Antitrust Act. It went on to become part of the ""Seven Sisters"", which dominated the world oil industry in the early 20th century. In 1926, the company changed its name to Standard Oil Co. of California (SOCAL). By the terms of the breakup of Standard Oil, Standard of California could use the Standard name only within its original geographic area of the Pacific coast states, plus Nevada and Arizona; outside that area, it had to use another name. The Chevron name came into use for some of its retail products in the 1930s. The name Calso was also used from 1946 to 1955 in states outside its native West Coast territory. California Standard's subsidiary, California-Arabian Standard Oil Company, grew over the years and became the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO) in 1944. In 1973, the Saudi government began buying into ARAMCO. By 1980, the company was entirely owned by the Saudis, and in 1988, its name was changed to Saudi Arabian Oil Company—Saudi Aramco. Standard Oil of California and Gulf Oil merged in 1984, which was the largest merger in history at that time. To comply with U.S. antitrust law,California Standard divested many of Gulf's operating subsidiaries, and sold some Gulf stations and a refinery in the eastern United States. (The refinery is currently owned by Sunoco.) Among the assets sold off were Gulf's retail outlets in Gulf's home market of Pittsburgh, where Chevron lacks a retail presence but does retain a regional headquarters there as of 2013, partially for Marcellus Shale-related drilling. In 1996 Chevron transferred its natural gas gathering, operating and marketing operation to NGC Corporation (later Dynegy) in exchange for a roughly 25% equity stake in NGC. Chevron employs approximately 62,000&#160;people (of which approximately 31,000 are employed in U.S. operations). In October 2015, Chevron announced that it is cutting up to 7,000 jobs, or 11 percent of its workforce. Chevron's oil and gas exploration and production operations are primarily in the US, Australia, Nigeria, Angola, Kazakhstan, and the Gulf of Mexico. As of December 31, 2010, the company had 10.545 billion barrels (1.6765&#160;billion cubic metres) of oil-equivalent net proved reserves. Daily production in 2010 was 2.763 million barrels per day (439.3&#160;thousand cubic metres per day). In the United States, the company operates approximately 11,000&#160;oil and natural gas wells in hundreds of fields occupying 4,000,000 acres (16,000&#160;km2) across the Permian Basin, located in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. In 2010, Chevron was the fourth largest producer in the region. Chevron's downstream operations manufacture and sell products such as fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals. The company's most significant areas of operations are the west coast of North America, the U.S. Gulf Coast, Southeast Asia, South Korea, Australia and South Africa. In 2010, Chevron sold an average 3.1 million barrels per day (490×10^3&#160;m3/d) of refined products like gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. In 2010, Chevron processed 1.9 million barrels per day (300×10^3&#160;m3/d) of crude oil. In 2007, Chevron and the United States Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) started collaboration to develop and produce algae fuel, which could be converted into transportation fuels, such as jet fuel. Between 2006 and 2011, Chevron contributed up to $12&#160;million to a strategic research alliance with the Georgia Institute of Technology to develop cellulosic biofuels and to create a process to convert biomass like wood or switchgrass into fuels. Additionally, Chevron holds a 22% stake in Galveston Bay Biodiesel LP, which produces up to 110&#160;million US gallons (420,000&#160;m3) of renewable biodiesel fuel a year. John S.

Stumpf Ronald Sugar Carl Ware Condoleezza Rice is a former member of the board of directors, and also headed Chevron's committee on public policy until she resigned on January 15, 2001, to become National Security Advisor to President George W. Bush. On September 30, 2009, John Watson, age 52, was elected Chairman of the Board and CEO, effective at the December 31, 2009 retirement of David J. O'Reilly. Niger Delta Partnership Initiative In 2010 Chevron established the Niger Delta Partnership Initiative (NDPI), a non-profit that works with local organizations to promote economic growth, reduce HIV transmission rates, and empower women. The Initiative was initially funded with a $50 million grant. An additional $40 million was donated in 2013. In 2003, a class action lawsuit against Chevron was filed in Ecuadorian court for $28 billion by indigenous residents, who accused Texaco of making residents ill and damaging forests and rivers by discharging 18&#160;billion US gallons (68,000,000&#160;m3) of formation water into the Amazon rainforest without any environmental remediation.

(March 2015) Cobasys LLC was a supplier of nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, battery control systems, and packaged solutions for automotive applications, uninterruptable power supplies, telecommunications applications, and distributed power generation. For 8 years ending in 2009, Cobasys was a 50-50 joint venture between California-based Chevron Corporation and Michigan-based Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. (also called ECD Ovonics, ECD, or Ovonics) In her book, Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that Will Recharge America, published in February 2007, Sherry Boschert argues that large-format NiMH batteries are commercially viable but that Cobasys refuses to sell the batteries or license the technology to small companies or individuals. Boschert argues that Cobasys accepts only very large orders for the batteries. Major automakers showed little interest in placing large orders for large-format NiMH batteries. However, Toyota complained about the difficulty in getting smaller orders of large format NiMH batteries to service the existing 825 RAV-4EVs. Because no other companies were willing to place large orders, Cobasys was not manufacturing or licensing large format NiMH battery technology for automobiles. Boschert concludes that ""it's possible that Cobasys (Chevron) is squelching all access to large NiMH batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline. Or it's possible that Cobasys simply wants the market for itself and is waiting for a major automaker to start producing plug-in hybrids or electric vehicles."" Soldiers shot at the activists and subsequently two activists (Jola Ogungbeje and Aroleka Irowaninu) died from their wounds. Prosecutors in Brazil initially demanded $10.6bn in the subsequent lawsuit. The National Petroleum Agency (ANP) suspended Chevron's activities in Brazil until it identified the cause of an oil spill off the coast of Rio de Janeiro."

(/tʃᵻˈpoʊtleɪ/) Founded by Steve Ells in July 1993, Chipotle had 16 restaurants (all in Colorado) when McDonald's Corporation became a major investor in 1998. By the time McDonald's fully divested itself from Chipotle in 2006, On January 26, 2006, Chipotle made its initial public offering (IPO) after increasing the share price twice due to high pre-IPO demand. In its first day as a public company, the stock rose exactly 100%, resulting in the best U.S.-based IPO in six years, and the second-best IPO for a restaurant after Boston Market. The money from the offering was then used to fund new store growth. In 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) audited Chipotle's Minneapolis restaurants, and found that some employees had been hired using fraudulent documents. In December, Chipotle fired 450 employees from its Minneapolis restaurants as a result of the audit, resulting in protests by local groups. The field team are the employees who work closely with but not directly within specific restaurants. The field support system includes apprentice team leaders (step up from restaurateurs), team leaders or area managers, team directors and regional directors (not atypical for them to oversee more than fifty locations). A Chipotle restaurant in Brandon, Florida, having the typical service-line layout with menu above Chipotle's menu consists of four items: burritos, bowls, tacos, and salads. The price of each item is based on the choice of chicken, pork carnitas (available only in some locations), or vegetarian (with guacamole, which would be at an extra charge otherwise). Additional optional toppings are offered free of charge, including: rice, beans, four types of salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce. Chicken Burrito Bowl The chain experimented with breakfast foods at two airports in the Washington (D.C.) metropolitan area but decided against expanding the menu in that direction. Chipotle's vegetarian options include rice, black beans, fajita vegetables (onions and bell peppers), salsa, guacamole and cheese. Steve Ells was prompted by an article written by Edward Behr to visit Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). Since 2006, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a Floridian farmworker organization, has protested Chipotle’s refusal to sign a Fair Food agreement, which would commit the restaurant chain to pay a penny-per-pound premium on its Florida tomatoes to boost tomato harvesters’ wages, and to only buy Florida tomatoes from growers who comply with the Fair Food Code of Conduct. In 2009, the creators of the documentary film Food, Inc. (along with 31 other leaders in the sustainable food movement) signed an open letter of support for the CIW’s campaign, stating that, “If Chipotle is sincere in its wishes to reform its supply chain, the time has come to work with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers as a true partner in the protection of farmworkers rights.”, one of which was not disclosed to the public"", Miller notes that ""a particularly worrisome aspect of the company's serial deficiencies is that there have been at least three unrelated pathogens in the outbreaks – Salmonella and E. coli bacteria and norovirus. In other words, there has been more than a single glitch; suppliers and employees have found a variety of ways to contaminate what Chipotle cavalierly sells (at premium prices) to its customers."" A writer for the North Carolina newspaper The News &amp; Observer called Chipotle's ""food with integrity"" a ""lucrative farce"" and a ""marketing ploy"" by pointing out that organic food is ""often grown with manure (an 'all-natural' fertilizer), which can certainly increase the risks of accidentally spreading fecal bacteria like E. coli."" As a precaution, Chipotle had closed 43 stores in Washington and Oregon pending the results and recommendations of the involved health authorities. On November 5, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had reported that the number of persons reported ill had risen to 40 known cases and that the bacteria samples taken from 7 infected persons in Washington and 3 persons in Oregon states were confirmed to be infected by the same strain of E. coli, the Shiga toxin-producing STEC O26 strain, as determined by DNA profiling. New cases were reported in the states of California (1), Illinois (1), Maryland (1), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (1), and Washington (1). Chipotle sponsors Team Garmin-Barracuda (formerly Team Garmin-Chipotle, Team Garmin-Slipstream, Team Garmin-Transitions and Team Garmin-Cervélo) of the International Cycling Union, The comedy is a satire of ""Big Ag"" and ""Big Food"" practices, featuring the fictional megacorporation Animoil feeding cows petropellets, which are made directly from petroleum, instead of corn and soybeans, which rely on ammonium nitrate fertilizers produced through the Haber–Bosch process, using natural gas as a source of energy. Cup and bag from the ""Cultivating Thought"" series, featuring the work of Paulo Coelho and Augusten Burroughs In 2014, Chipotle debuted their ""Cultivate: Food, Ideas &amp; Music Festival"" in several cities across the nation. 2015 festivals are scheduled for Phoenix, Kansas City, and Minneapolis. Cultivate headlines of-the-moment bands and draws huge crowds to the free festival. In between band performances, attendees can enjoy food, drinks, activities, free samples from partners (such as Ben &amp; Jerry's), and informational and interactive programs displaying Chipotle's responsible farming methods. The exterior of a Chipotle in Durham, North Carolina Architecturally, all Chipotle restaurants are built using most of the same materials (plywood, corrugated metal, stainless steel, exposed ductwork), although each store is unique. Chipotle was the defendant in a lawsuit for failure to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Maurizio Antoninetti, a customer who used a wheelchair, claimed he was denied the ""Chipotle Experience"", because he was unable to see the food preparation. The case against the company was upheld in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, ^ Shambora, Jessica (2010-10-08). ""Chipotle: Rise of a fast-food empire"". CNNMoney.

Headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, Cintas designs, manufactures and implements corporate identity uniform programs and provides entrance mats, restroom cleaning and supplies, tile and carpet cleaning, promotional products, first aid, safety, fire protection products and services for businesses. Cintas Corporation began in 1929 as the Acme Industrial Laundry Company by Richard (Doc) Farmer. He collected chemical-soaked rags from factories and washed and returned them to customers for a fee. In the early 40's, rags were replaced by shop towels—which are uniform in size and shape and much more absorbent than old rags—and tablecloths. By then, the company’s name had changed to Acme Wiper and Industrial Laundry. His grandson Richard T. Farmer joined the family business in 1956 after graduating from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Acme had just 15 employees at the time. Dick helped uniform rental sales increase from $300,000 in 1959 to $847,000 in 1963. He then put together a business plan to open small uniform rental plants all over the United States. The first opened in Cleveland in October 1968. In 1972, the company changed its name to Cintas and then went public in 1983. Farmer also tried products that were new at the time, such as fabrics that resisted wrinkles and stains, to grow the company to an almost 30 percent market share in uniforms. Cintas' recent growth has been primarily through its acquisition of more than 220 companies, eliminating overheads and cutting costs. Today, Cintas has bought itself into markets such as first aid and safety, fire protection, facility services, and tile and carpet cleaning.

On August 28, 1990, Lerner was fired; upon hearing the news, her husband Bosack resigned in protest. The couple walked away from Cisco with $170&#160;million, 70% of which was committed to their own charity. Classical, CPU-based architecture of early Cisco devices coupled with flexibility of operating system IOS allowed for keeping up with evolving technology needs by means of frequent software upgrades. Some popular models of that time (such as Cisco 2500) managed to stay in production for almost a decade virtually unchanged—a rarity in high-tech industry. Although Cisco was strongly rooted in the enterprise environment, the company was quick to capture the emerging service provider environment, entering the SP market with new, high-capacity product lines such as Cisco 7000 and Cisco 8500. Between 1992 and 1994, Cisco acquired several companies in Ethernet switching, such as Kalpana, Grand Junction, and most notably, Mario Mazzola's Crescendo Communications which together formed the Catalyst business unit. At the time, the company envisioned layer 3 routing and layer 2 (Ethernet, Token Ring) switching as complementary functions of different intelligence and architecture—the former was slow and complex, the latter was fast but simple. This philosophy dominated the company's product lines throughout the 1990s. In 1995, John Morgridge was succeeded by John Chambers. The phenomenal growth of the Internet in mid-to-late 1990s quickly changed the telecom landscape. As the Internet Protocol (IP) became widely adopted, the importance of multi-protocol routing declined. Nevertheless, Cisco managed to catch the Internet wave, with products ranging from modem access shelves (AS5200) to core GSR routers that quickly became vital to Internet service providers and by 1998 gave Cisco de facto monopoly in this critical segment. In late March 2000, at the height of the dot-com bubble, Cisco became the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of more than US$500&#160;billion. These efforts were meant to make Cisco a ""household"" brand—a strategy designed to support the low-end Linksys products and future consumer products (such as Flip Video camera acquired by Cisco in 2009). On the more traditional business side, Cisco continued to develop its extensive enterprise-focused routing, switching and security portfolio. The quickly growing importance of Ethernet also influenced the company's product lines, prompting the company to morph the successful Catalyst 6500 Ethernet switch into all-purpose Cisco 7600 routing platform. However, Cisco continued to be challenged by both domestic Alcatel-Lucent, Juniper Networks and overseas competitors Huawei. Due to lower-than-expected profit in 2011, Cisco was forced to reduce annual expenses by $1&#160;billion. The company cut around 3,000 employees with an early-retirement program who accepted buyout and planned to eliminate as many as 10,000 jobs (around 14 percent of the 73,400 total employees before curtailment). including Juniper and HP. On 24 July 2012, Cisco received approval from the EU to acquire NDS (a TV software developer) for USD 5 billion. In April, 2014, Cisco Systems announced $150 Million to fund early-stage firms around the globe to focus on the Internet of Everything. The investment fund was allocated to investments in IoT accelerators and startups such as The Alchemist Accelerator, Ayla Networks and EVRYTHNG. After the announcement, The Alchemist Accelerator announced Cisco as a strategic partner and launched an individual program specifically focused on advancing the growth of IoT startups. This new funding increased Cisco Investments' thematic investing to $250 million total, adding to the previously announced $100 million commitment to startups focused on the emerging Internet of Everything (IoE) market opportunity. In January 2016, Cisco invested in VeloCloud, a software-defined WAN (SD-WAN) start-up with a cloud offering for configuring and optimizing branch office networks. Cisco contributed to VeloCloud's $27 million Series C round, led by March Capital Partners. Cisco is one of two strategic investors. According to a report by technology consulting firm LexInnova, Cisco is one of the leading recipients of network security-related patents with the largest portfolio within other companies (6,442 security-related patents). Several acquired companies have grown into $1Bn+ business units for Cisco, including LAN switching, Enterprise Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP) platform Webex and home networking. The latter came as result of Cisco acquiring Linksys in 2003 and in 2010 was supplemented with new product line dubbed Cisco Valet. Cisco announced on January 12, 2005, that it would acquire Airespace for US$450 million to reinforce the wireless controller product lines. In more recent merger deals, Cisco bought Starent Networks (a mobile packet core company) and Moto Development Group, a product design consulting firm that helped develop Cisco's Flip video camera. Although many buy-ins (such as Crescendo Networks in 1993, Tandberg in 2010) resulted in acquisition of flagship technology to Cisco, many others have failed—partially or completely. revenues were still not on par with US$7&#160;billion price tag paid in 1999 for Cerent. Some of acquired technologies (such as Flip from Pure Digital) saw their product lines terminated. In the same month, Cisco Systems acquired Cognitive Security, a company focused on Cyber Threat Protection. Cisco also acquired SolveDirect (cloud services) in March 2013 and Ubiquisys (mobile software) in April 2013. Cisco acquired cyber-security firm Sourcefire, in October 2013.

A number of specialist technician, sales and datacenter certifications are also available. Cisco also provides training for these certifications via a portal called the Cisco Networking Academy. Qualifying schools can become members of the Cisco Networking Academy and then provide CCNA level or other level courses. Cisco Academy Instructors must be CCNA certified to be a CCAI certified instructor. Cisco often finds itself involved with technical education. With over 10,000 partnerships in over 65 countries On October 16, 2007, the Brazilian Federal Police and Brazilian Receita Federal (equivalent to the American IRS), under the ""Persona Operation"", uncovered an alleged tax fraud scheme employed by Cisco Systems Brazil Chief Carlos Roberto Carnevali since 2002 that exempted the company from paying over R$1.5&#160;billion (US$824&#160;million) in taxes. against Cisco Systems, Inc. in an effort to open up the network maintenance services marketplace for Cisco equipment, promote competition and ensure consumer choice and value. Multiven's complaint alleges that Cisco harmed Multiven and consumers by bundling and tying bug fixes/patches and updates for its operating system software to its maintenance services (SMARTnet) and through a series of other illegal exclusionary and anticompetitive acts designed to maintain Cisco's alleged monopoly in the network maintenance services market for Cisco networking equipment. In May 2010 Cisco has accused the person who filed the antitrust suit, British-Nigerian technology entrepreneur Peter Alfred-Adekeye, with hacking and pressured the US government to extradite him from Canada. Alfred-Adekeye was arrested while in the middle of testifying against Cisco in an anti-trust hearing. On July 20, 2015, Multiven CEO, Peter Alfred-Adekeye filed a libel lawsuit against Cisco for (1) falsely claiming that ‘he or someone under his control at Multiven’ downloaded and ‘stole’ Cisco software five times in 2006 from cisco.com (2) using this lie to orchestrate his illegal arrest in Vancouver, Canada in 2010 and (3) continuing to knowingly propagate this falsehood till today. According to the German magazine Der Spiegel the NSA has developed JETPLOW for gaining access to ASA (series 5505, 5510, 5520, 5540 and 5550) and 500-series PIX Firewalls. A document included in the trove of National Security Agency files released with Glenn Greenwald’s book No Place to Hide details how the agency’s Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit and other NSA employees intercept servers, routers and other network gear being shipped to organizations targeted for surveillance and install covert firmware onto them before they’re delivered. These Trojan horse systems were described by an NSA manager as being “some of the most productive operations in TAO because they pre-position access points into hard target networks around the world.”"

Citigroup was formed from one of the world's largest mergers in history by combining the banking giant Citicorp and financial conglomerate Travelers Group in October 1998 (announced on April 7, 1998). A special IRS tax exception given to Citi allowed the US Treasury to sell its shares at a profit, while it still owned Citigroup shares, which eventually netted $12&#160;billion. According to Treasury spokeswoman Nayyera Haq, ""This (IRS tax) rule was designed to stop corporate raiders from using loss corporations to evade taxes, and was never intended to address the unprecedented situation where the government owned shares in banks. And it was certainly not written to prevent the government from selling its shares for a profit.""

As such, the company history dates back to the founding of: the City Bank of New York (later Citibank) in 1812; Bank Handlowy in 1870; Smith Barney in 1873, Banamex in 1884; Salomon Brothers in 1910. As it grew, the bank became a leading innovator in financial services, becoming the first major U.S. bank to offer compound interest on savings (1921); unsecured personal loans (1928); customer checking accounts (1936) and the negotiable certificate of deposit (1961). In 1976, under the leadership of CEO Walter B. Wriston, First National City Bank (and its holding company First National City Corporation) was renamed as Citibank, N.A. (and Citicorp, respectively). Shortly afterward, the bank launched the Citicard, which pioneered the use of 24-hour ATMs. The corporate logo of Travelers Inc. (1993–1998) prior to merger with Citicorp. Travelers Group, at the time of merger, was a diverse group of financial concerns that had been brought together under CEO Sandy Weill. Its roots came from Commercial Credit, a subsidiary of Control Data Corporation that was taken private by Weill in November 1986 after taking charge of the company earlier that year. In November 1997, Travelers Group (which had been renamed again in April 1995 when they merged with Aetna Property and Casualty, Inc.), made the $9&#160;billion deal to purchase Salomon Brothers, a major bond dealer and bulge bracket investment bank. In 2000, Citigroup acquired Associates First Capital Corporation, which, until 1989, had been owned by Gulf+Western (now part of National Amusements). and Banamex (assisted by independent adviser, Windsor Capital Investments Limited) in August, for $12.5&#160;billion. Heavy exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of collateralized debt obligation (CDOs), compounded by poor risk management, led Citigroup into trouble as the subprime mortgage crisis worsened 2008. The company had used elaborate mathematical risk models which looked at mortgages in particular geographical areas, but never included the possibility of a national housing downturn, or the prospect that millions of mortgage holders would default on their mortgages. Trading head Thomas Maheras was close friends with senior risk officer David Bushnell, which undermined risk oversight. As Treasury Secretary, Robert Rubin was said to be influential in lifting the regulations that allowed Travelers and Citicorp to merge in 1998. Then on the board of directors of Citigroup, Rubin and Charles Prince were said to be influential in pushing the company towards MBS and CDOs in the subprime mortgage market. Starting in June 2006, Senior Vice President Richard M. Bowen III, the chief underwriter of Citigroup's Consumer Lending Group, began warning the board of directors about the extreme risks being taken on by the mortgage operation that could potentially result in massive losses. The group bought and sold $90 billion of residential mortgages annually. Bowen's responsibility was essentially to serve as the quality control supervisor ensuring the unit's creditworthiness. When Bowen first blew the whistle in 2006, 60% of the mortgages were defective. The amount of bad mortgages began increasing throughout 2007 and eventually exceeded 80% of the volume. Many of the mortgages were not only defective, but were fraudulent. Bowen attempted to rouse the board via weekly reports and other communications. On November 3, 2007, Bowen emailed Citigroup Chairman Robert Rubin and the bank's chief financial officer, head auditor and the chief risk management officer to again expose the risk and potential losses, claiming that the group's internal controls had broken down and requesting an outside investigation of his business unit. The subsequent investigation revealed that at the Consumer Lending Group had suffered a breakdown of internal controls since 2005. Regardless of the findings of the investigation, Bowen's charges were ignored, despite the fact that withholding such information from shareholders violated the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX), which he had pointed out. Citigroup CEO Charles Prince signed a certification that the bank was in compliance with SOX despite Bowen revealing this wasn't so. Citigroup eventually stripped Bowen of most of his responsibilities and informing him that his physical presence was no longer required at the bank. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission asked him to testify about Citigroup's role in the mortgage crisis, and he did so, appearing as one of the first witnesses before the Commission in April 2010. Even after securities and brokerage firm Bear Stearns ran into serious trouble in summer 2007, Citigroup decided the possibility of trouble with its CDO's was so tiny (less than 1/100 of 1%) that they excluded them from their risk analysis. With the crisis worsening, Citigroup announced on January 7, 2008 that it was considering cutting another 5 percent to 10 percent of its 327,000 member-workforce. November 2008, Collapse &amp; US Government Intervention (part of the Global Financial Crisis) The arrangement calls for the government to back about $306&#160;billion in loans and securities and directly invest about $20&#160;billion in the company. The Treasury would provide $20&#160;billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds in addition to $25&#160;billion given in October. The Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) would cover 90% of the losses on its $335&#160;billion portfolio after Citigroup absorbed the first $29&#160;billion in losses. In July 2015, Citi agreed to sell its retail and commercial banking operations in Panama and Costa Rica to Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank). The operations being sold include 27 branches serving approximately 250,000 clients in the two countries. Citi will continue to offer corporate and institutional banking and wealth management in Panama and Costa Rica. while Citi Holdings contains Citi's non-core businesses, i.e. Brokerage and Asset Management (formerly includes Smith Barney), Global Consumer Finance, and Citi's Special Asset Portfolios. Citibank (Retail Banking) Retail banking encompasses Citi's global branch network, branded Citibank. Citibank has more than 4,600 branches in the world and holds more than $300&#160;billion deposits. Citibank is the fourth largest retail bank in the United States (Wells Fargo gained #3 spot in early 2016) based on deposits, and it has Citibank branded branches in countries throughout the world, with the exception of Mexico which is under a separate subsidiary called Banamex. Banamex, which serves about 20&#160;million clients, is Mexico's largest local financial institution as measured by assets. Citibank offers Citibank/Citigold Checking and Savings accounts, Small Business and Commercial Banking and Personal Wealth Management among its services. In 2011, Citi is the first bank to introduce digitized Smart Banking branches in Washington, D.C., New York, Tokyo and Busan (South Korea) while continued renovating its entire branch network. Its highest tiered service, Citigold Private Client, is for high-net-worth individuals with at least $1–$3&#160;million in liquid assets (depending on the market region) and offers access to investments and ideas from Citi Private Bank. Citi's Institutional Clients Group (ICG) offers investment and corporate banking services and products for corporates, governments, institutions, and ultra high-net-worth investors. Containing Citi's most market-sensitive divisions, ICG consists of five main divisions: Citi Capital Markets Origination, Citi Markets &amp; Securities Services (including Citi Research), Citi Corporate &amp; Investment Banking, Citi Private Bank, and Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions. Citi Capital Markets Origination Former Transactions Service unit, Securities Funds Services, was merged with Citi Markets to form Citi Markets &amp; Securities Services. The current unit includes Investor Services and Direct Custody and Clearing, Hedge and Private Equity Servicing, and Issuer businesses. It provides financial products through underwriting, sales &amp; trading of a range of investment assets. Products offered include equities, commodities, credit, futures, foreign exchange (FX), emerging markets, G10 rates, municipals, prime finance/brokerage services, and securitized markets, such as collateralized debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities. Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS)  provides cash management, trade and securities services to companies, governments, and other institutions in the U.S. and more than 140 countries. TTS intermediates more than $3&#160;trillion in global transactions daily. It has over $13&#160;trillion assets under custody, about $377&#160;billion in average liability balances, serves 99% of world's Fortune 100 companies and ~85% of the world's Fortune 500 companies, and has 10 regional processing centers worldwide using global processes. Institutions use TTS to support their treasury operations with global solutions for payments, collections, liquidity and investments by working in partnership with export credit agencies and development banks. It also sells supply chain financing products as well as medium- and long-term global financing programs across multiple industries. In 2011, clients doing business with Citi in 10 or more countries generated more than 60 percent of Transaction Services' total revenues. According to the Wall Street Journal, the government aid provided to Citi in 2008/2009 was provided to prevent a world-wide chaos and panic by the potential collapse of its Global Transactions Services (now TTS) division. According to the article, former CEO Pandit said if Citigroup was allowed to unravel into bankruptcy, ""100 governments around the world would be trying to figure out how to pay their employees"". Citi Holdings consists of Citi businesses that Citi wants to sell and are not considered part of Citi's core businesses. The majority of its assets are U.S. mortgages. It was created in the wake of the financial crisis as part of Citi's restructuring plan. It consists of several business entities including remaining interests in local consumer lending such as OneMain Financial, divestitures such as Smith Barney, and a special asset pool. Citi Holdings represents $156 billion of GAAP assets, or ~8% of Citigroup; 59% represents North American mortgages, 18% operating businesses, 13% special asset pool, and 10% categorized as other. Operating businesses include OneMain Financial ($10B), PrimeRe ($7B), MSSB JV ($8B) and Spain / Greece retail ($4B), less associated loan loss reserves. While Citi Holdings is a mixed bag, its primary objective is to wind down some non-core businesses and reduce assets, and strategically ""breaking even"" in 2015. In October 2014, Citigroup announced it will exit consumer banking in 11 markets, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Japan, Guam, the Czech Republic, Egypt, South Korea (consumer finance only), and Hungary. Citi Capital Advisors (CCA), Citigroup Center, Chicago Citigroup EMEA headquarters, Canary Wharf, London Citigroup Centre in Sydney Citigroup's most famous office building is the Citigroup Center, a diagonal-roof skyscraper located in East Midtown, Manhattan, New York City, which despite popular belief is not the company's headquarters building. Citigroup has its headquarters across the street in an anonymous-looking building at 399 Park Avenue (the site of the original location of the City National Bank). All of Citigroup's New York City real estate, excluding the company's Smith Barney division and Wall Street trading division, lies along the New York City Subway's IND Queens Boulevard Line, served by the E M&#160;trains. Consequently, the company's Midtown buildings—including 787 Seventh Avenue, 666 Fifth Avenue, 399 Park Avenue, 485 Lexington, 153 East 53rd Street (Citigroup Center) in Manhattan, and Citigroup Building in Long Island City, Queens, are all on the short four-stop corridor of the Queens Boulevard Line between Court Square and Seventh Avenue. On March 23, 2005, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the former name of the American self-regulatory organization for broker-dealers, now known as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FInRA) announced total fines of $21.25&#160;million against Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., American Express Financial Advisors and Chase Investment Services regarding suitability and supervisory violations of their mutual fund sales practices between January 2002 and July 2003. The case against Citigroup involved recommendations and sales of Class B and Class C shares of mutual funds. On February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a historic settlement with the federal government and 49 states. The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in direct payments to the states and federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. In response, Richard Parsons, former chairman of Citigroup, called the vote a ""serious matter"". A spokeswoman for Citi said ""Citi's Board of Directors takes the shareholder vote seriously, and along with senior management will consult with representative shareholders to understand their concerns"" and that the Compensation committee of the Board ""will carefully consider their (shareholder) input as we move forward"". Citigroup’s 2014 donations favored Republicans only slightly. The bank’s PAC had been nearly as generous to Democrats as Republicans&#160;– $30,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (the maximum) and $10,000 to the 'New Democrat Coalition', a group of moderate Democrats most of whom voted for the 2015 spending package. Citibank’s PAC made donations to both the campaigns and the leadership PACs of many top Democrats who voted for the 2015 spending bill, including Steny Hoyer (Md.) House Democratic Whip and Representatives Jim Himes (D-Conn.) and Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Florida.). In 2009, former chairman Richard Parsons hired long-time Washington, D.C. lobbyist Richard F. Hohlt to advise him and the company about relations with the U.S. government, though not to lobby for the company. While some speculated anonymously that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) would have been a particular focus of Hohlt's attention, Hohlt said he'd had no contact with the government insurance corporation. Some former regulators found room to criticize Hohlt's involvement with Citigroup, because of his earlier involvement with the financial-services industry during the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s. Hohlt responded that though mistakes were made in the earlier episode he'd never been investigated by any government agency and his experience gave him reason to be back in the ""operating room"" as parties address the more recent crisis."

The company operates a franchised distribution system dating from 1889 where The Coca-Cola Company only produces syrup concentrate which is then sold to various bottlers throughout the world who hold an exclusive territory. The Coca-Cola Company owns its anchor bottler in North America, Coca-Cola Refreshments. Its stock is listed on the NYSE (NYSE: KO) and is part of DJIA; S&amp;P 500 index; the Russell 1000 Index; and the Russell 1000 Growth Stock Index.

In general, the Coca-Cola Company and its subsidiaries only produce syrup concentrate, which is then sold to various bottlers throughout the world who hold the local Coca-Cola franchise. Coca-Cola bottlers, who hold territorially exclusive contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. The bottlers then sell, distribute and merchandise the resulting Coca-Cola product to retail stores, vending machines, restaurants and food service distributors. Outside the United States, the bottlers also control the fountain business. Since the early 1980s, the Company has actively encouraged the consolidation of bottlers with the Company often owning a share of these ""anchor bottlers"". The Company's largest bottlers outside North America are: Coca-Cola Amatil, based in Australia (Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, South Pacific nations) (Company owns share) Coca-Cola European Partners PLC, based in the United Kingdom (western Europe) (Company owns share) Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc., based in the Philippines, a joint venture between the Company and Coca-Cola FEMSA Coca-Cola FEMSA, based in Mexico (parts of Mexico and Latin America) (Company owns share) Arca Continental, also based in Mexico (parts of Mexico and Latin America) (independent) Embotelladora Andina S.A, based in Chile (southern South America) (independent) Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, based in Port Elizabeth, South Africa (southern and eastern Africa) (company owns share) Coca-Cola Korea, based in South Korea (independent) Coca-Cola HBC AG, originally based in Greece but now located in Switzerland (Greece, Eastern Europe, Russia, and Nigeria) (Company owns share) Coca-Cola Icecek, based in Turkey (Turkey, southwest Asia, Arabia) (Company owns share) Swire Group, based in Hong Kong (China, Taiwan, Hong Kong) (independent) Kirin Company, based in Japan (independent) In the United States, the company bypasses bottlers and is responsible for the manufacture and sale of fountain syrups directly to authorized fountain wholesalers and some fountain retailers. After purchase of the North American assets of Coca-Cola Enterprises, as of 2014 the company directly owned 100% of Coca-Cola Refreshments, the anchor bottler of Coca-Cola products in North America, representing about 90% of Canada and 80% of the United States. Other major bottlers in the United States are: Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, based in Charlotte, North Carolina (company owns share) Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Northern New England based in Bedford, New Hampshire and owned by Kirin Company Coca-Cola Bottling Company United, based in Birmingham, Alabama (independent) Swire Coca-Cola USA, based in Salt Lake City, Utah and owned by Swire Group In September 2015, the company announced the sale of several production plants and territories to Swire, Consolidated, and United and creation of the Coca-Cola National Product Supply System which controls 95% of the territory in the United States. Main article: List of Coca-Cola brands Coca-Cola Company's office building in Madrid (Spain) The Coca-Cola Company offers more than 350 brands in over 200 countries, aside from its namesake Coca-Cola beverage. Brands The Coca-Cola Company also produces a number of other soft drinks including Fanta (introduced circa 1941) and Sprite. Fanta's origins date back to World War II during a trade embargo against Germany on cola syrup, making it impossible to sell Coca-Cola in Germany. Max Keith, the head of Coca-Cola's German office during the war, decided to create a new product for the German market, made from products only available in Germany at the time, which they named Fanta. During the 1990s, the company responded to the growing consumer interest in healthy beverages by introducing several new non-carbonated beverage brands. These included Minute Maid Juices to Go, Powerade sports beverage, flavored tea Nestea (in a joint venture with Nestle), Fruitopia fruit drink and Dasani water, among others. In 2001, Minute Maid division launched the Simply Orange brand of juices including orange juice. In 2004, perhaps in response to the burgeoning popularity of low-carbohydrate diets such as the Atkins diet, Coca-Cola announced its intention to develop and sell a low-carbohydrate alternative to Coke Classic, dubbed C2 Cola. C2 contains a mix of high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, sucralose, and Acesulfame potassium. C2 is designed to more closely emulate the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. Even with less than half of the food energy and carbohydrates of standard soft drinks, C2 is not a replacement for zero-calorie soft drinks such as Diet Coke. C2 went on sale in the U.S. on June 11, 2004, and in Canada in August 2004. C2's future is uncertain due to disappointing sales. Starting in 2009, The Coca-Cola Company invested in Innocent Drinks, first with a minor stake, increasing to 90% in the first quarter of 2013. Best selling While the Middle East is one of the only regions in the world where Coca-Cola is not the number one soda drink, Coca-Cola nonetheless holds almost 25% marketshare (to Pepsi's 75%) and had double-digit growth in 2003. In Peru, the native Inca Kola has been more popular than Coca-Cola, which prompted Coca-Cola to enter in negotiations with the soft drink's company and buy 50% of its stakes. In Japan, the best selling soft drink is not cola, as (canned) tea and coffee are more popular. On May 25, 2007, Coca-Cola announced it would purchase Glaceau, a maker of flavored vitamin-enhanced drinks (vitamin water), flavored waters, and Burn energy drinks, for $4.1&#160;billion in cash.) for US$2.4bn (HK$12.20 per share). Coca-Cola sponsored the English Football League from the beginning of the 2004–05 season (beginning August 2004) to the start of 2010/11 season, when the Football League replaced it with NPower. Along with this, Coca-Cola sponsored the Coca-Cola Football Camp, that took place in Pretoria, South Africa during the 2010 FIFA World Cup, during which hundreds of teenagers from around the world were able to come together and share their love of the game, partly due to Best Buy's efforts through their @15 program. While not necessarily having naming rights to anything in all locations, the company does sponsor and provide beverages in many theme parks, usually in an exclusive capacity. This includes the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, Merlin Entertainment, Universal Parks &amp; Resorts, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, SeaWorld Entertainment, and Parques Reunidos, which are seven of the eight largest theme park operators worldwide (it is unknown whether OCT Parks China, the fourth largest theme park operator, uses Coca-Cola)."

These include business &amp; technology consulting, systems integration, application development &amp; maintenance, IT infrastructure services, analytics, business intelligence, data warehousing, CRM, supply chain management, engineering &amp; manufacturing Solutions, ERP, R&amp;D outsourcing, and testing solutions. In 2011, the company's revenue from IT services was split roughly evenly between application development and application maintenance. Its business process outsourcing portfolio leans towards ""higher-end"" services i.e., work that involves domain knowledge and skills, such as legal services or healthcare claims processing rather than simple voice-based support services. In the 2012 earnings announcements, the CEO Francisco D'Souza categorized the company's service offerings in three groups: Horizon 1 (application development and maintenance), Horizon 2 (BPO, IT Infrastructure Services &amp; business consulting) and Horizon 3 (""SMAC"" - Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud). Cognizant's original corporate headquarters in Chennai, now an offshore delivery center. Like many other IT services firms, Cognizant follows a global delivery model based on offshore software R&amp;D and offshore outsourcing. The company has a number of offshore development centers outside the United States and near-shore centers in the U.S., Europe and South America. In its early years, Cognizant gained business from a number of American and European companies with the help of the Dun &amp; Bradstreet brand. The company's senior executives envisaged the firm as a provider of high-end customer services on-par with the six contemporary major system integrators (Accenture, BearingPoint, Capgemini, E&amp;Y, Deloitte and IBM), but at lower prices. In 2009, an investigation by the US Department of Labor (DoL) found Cognizant in violation of the H-1B provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Administrative Act. DoL found that 67 of its workers hired under the H-1B program were underpaid. According to Cognizant, this was due to unintentional administrative errors. The DoL investigation revealed that Cognizant had achieved 99.7% compliance in its management of H-1B visa-related issues. Mangalore (CoreLogic), Mumbai, and Pune. The company has local, regional, and global delivery centers in the UK, Hungary, Spain, China, The Philippines, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. Cognizant is organized into several verticals and horizontal units. The vertical units focus on specific industries such as Banking &amp; Financial Services, Healthcare, Manufacturing and Retail. The horizontals focus on specific technologies or process areas such as Analytics, mobile computing, BPO and Testing. Both horizontal and vertical units have business consultants, who together form the organization-wide Cognizant Business Consulting (CBC) team. Cognizant is among the largest recruiters of MBAs in the industry; they are involved in business development and business analysis for IT services projects. According to the 2011 financial statements, the major portion of Cognizant's revenues is derived from clients in the Financial Services (42.3%) and Healthcare (25.9%) industries. Other substantial revenue sources include clients from Manufacturing, Retail &amp; Logistics (18.6%) and Communications, Information, Media &amp; Entertainment and Technology (13.2%) industries. By geography, most of the revenue is derived from North America (77.2%) and Europe (19.2%). The company's flagship customer conference is Cognizant Community—sometimes simply called Community. It is held annually in the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia (Singapore, India and Japan). The summit, which features notable keynote speakers in the world of business, technology, economics and even adventure sports, has been praised as ""a model industry event"". Cognizant's philanthropic and corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives are conducted through the voluntary efforts of Cognizant employees and the financial and administrative support of the Cognizant Foundation. Registered in March 2005 as a ""Charitable Company"" under the Indian Companies Act, the Cognizant Foundation aims to help ""unprivileged members of society gain access to quality education and healthcare by providing financial and technical support; designing and implementing educational and healthcare improvement programs; and partnering with Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), educational institutions, healthcare institutions, government agencies and corporations"".

Under its ""Hill's"" brand, it is also a manufacturer of veterinary products. The company's corporate offices are on Park Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. In 1896, the company sold the first toothpaste in a tube, Colgate Ribbon Dental Cream (invented by dentist Washington Sheffield). Also in 1896, Colgate hired Martin Ittner and under his direction founded one of the first applied research labs. By 1908 they initiated mass sales of toothpaste in tubes. William's other son, James Boorman Colgate, was a primary trustee of Colgate University (formerly Madison University). 1915 magazine ad In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the B.J. Johnson Company was making a soap entirely of palm oil and olive oil, the formula of which was developed by B.J. Johnson in 1898. The soap was popular enough to rename their company after it - ""Palmolive"". Around the start of the 20th century Palmolive, which contained both palm and olive oils, was the world's best-selling soap. Extensive advertising included the radio programs The Palmolive Hour (1927-1931) and Palmolive Beauty Box Theater (1934-1937). A Missouri-based soap manufacturer known as Peet Brothers merged with Palmolive to become Palmolive-Peet. In 1928, Palmolive-Peet bought the Colgate Company to create the Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Company. In 1953 ""Peet"" was dropped from the title, leaving only ""Colgate-Palmolive Company"", the current name. Colgate-Palmolive has long been in competition with Procter &amp; Gamble, the world's largest soap and detergent maker. P&amp;G introduced its Tide laundry detergent shortly after World War II, and thousands of consumers turned from Colgate's soaps to the new product. Colgate lost its number one place in the toothpaste market when P&amp;G added fluoride to its toothpaste. In the beginning of TV, Colgate-Palmolive wished to compete with P&amp;G as a sponsor of soap operas and sponsored many soaps in full or in part including The Doctors. George Henry Lesch, president, CEO, and chairman of the board of Colgate-Palmolive in the 1960s and 1970s, during that time transformed it into a modern company with major restructuring. In 2005, Colgate sold the under-performing brands Fab, Dynamo, Arctic Power, ABC, Cold Power and Fresh Start, as well as the license of the Ajax brand for laundry detergents in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico, to Phoenix Brands, LLC as part of their plan to focus on their higher margin oral, personal, and pet care products. The Colgate Women's Games is the nation's largest amateur track series open to all girls from elementary school through college. Held at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, competitors participate in preliminary meets and semi-finals over five weekends throughout January. Finalists compete for trophies and educational grants-in-aid from Colgate-Palmolive Company at New York City's Madison Square Garden in February. For more than 20 years, the company supports the Starlight Children Foundation which is a non profit organization dedicated to help seriously ill children and their families. The mission is to help children to cope with pain, fear and isolation through entertainment, family activities and education.(2012) Ethical record In 2011, Colgate-Palmolive was one of the first companies recognized by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) under the new ""working for regulatory change"" category for companies that test on animals only when mandated by government regulations and are actively seeking alternatives to animal testing. Their involvement in this site may have contributed to the contamination of an estimated 18,500 cubic yards (14,100&#160;m3) of soil with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), PCBs, and lead off-site. A proposed $23 million agreement with the government and state of New Jersey would require Colgate-Palmolive and the other involved companies to pay for the cleanup of this hazardous waste that is contaminating the soil as well as the groundwater.

Comcast operates multiple cable-only channels (including E! Entertainment Television, the Golf Channel, and NBCSN), over-the-air national broadcast network channels (NBC and Telemundo), the film production studio Universal Pictures, and Universal Parks &amp; Resorts, with a global total of nearly 200 family entertainment locations and attractions in the U.S. and several other countries including U.A.E., South Korea, Russia and China, with several new locations reportedly planned and being developed for future operation. Comcast also has significant holding in digital distribution (thePlatform). In February 2014 the company agreed to merge with Time Warner Cable in an equity swap deal worth $45.2 billion. Under the terms of the agreement Comcast was to acquire 100% of Time Warner Cable. Given Comcast's negotiating power as a large ISP, some suspect that Comcast could leverage paid peering agreements to unfairly influence end-user connection speeds. Its ownership of both content production (in NBCUniversal) and content distribution (as an ISP) has raised antitrust concerns. These issues, in addition to others, led to Comcast being dubbed ""The Worst Company in America"" by The Consumerist in 2014 and 2010.

The 975&#160;ft (297&#160;m) skyscraper is the tallest building in Pennsylvania. Comcast has begun construction on a second 1,121&#160;ft (342&#160;m) skyscraper directly adjacent to the original Comcast headquarters in the summer of 2014. Increasing market share (1990–2000) Largest US cable provider (2001–present) This also spurred the start of Comcast Advertising Sales (using AT&amp;T's groundwork) which would later be renamed Comcast Spotlight. As part of this acquisition, Comcast also acquired the National Digital Television Center in Centennial, Colorado as a wholly owned subsidiary, which is today known as the Comcast Media Center. On February 11, 2004, Comcast announced a $54&#160;billion bid for The Walt Disney Company, as well as taking on $12&#160;billion of Disney's debt. The deal would have made Comcast the largest media conglomerate in the world. In December 2005, Comcast announced the creation of Comcast Interactive Media, a new division focused on online media. In July 2006, Comcast purchased the Seattle-based software company thePlatform. This represented an entry into a new line of business – selling software to allow companies to manage their Internet (and IP-based) media publishing efforts. On April 3, 2007, Comcast announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire the cable systems owned and operated by Patriot Media, a privately held company owned by cable veteran Steven J. Simmons, Spectrum Equity Investors and Spire Capital, that serves approximately 81,000 video subscribers. Comcast will acquire Patriot for a net cash investment of approximately $483&#160;million. Comcast won the Consumerist Worst Company In America (""Golden Poo"") award in 2010. The two companies paid a total of $17.6&#160;billion in the deal that was finalized in the second quarter of 2006—after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) completed a seven-month investigation without raising an objection. In August 2015, Comcast announced to speed up Internet for low income customers from 5 megabits per second (mbps) to 10 Mbit/s, provide free wireless routers, and will pilot an initiative to increase Internet access for low-income senior citizens. Comcast Cable (Xfinity) Comcast-Spectacor holdings now include the Philadelphia Flyers NHL hockey team, the Philadelphia 76ers National Basketball Association basketball team and two large multipurpose arenas in Philadelphia. Over a number of years, Comcast became majority owner of Comcast SportsNet, as well as Golf Channel and NBCSN (formerly the Outdoor Life Network, then Versus). In 2002, Comcast paid the University of Maryland $25&#160;million for naming rights to the new basketball arena built on the College Park campus, the XFINITY Center. Before it was renamed for Comcast's cable subsidiary, XFINITY Center was called Comcast Center from its opening in 2002 through July 2014. Venture capital Main article: Criticism of Comcast Comcast service van, Ypsilanti Township, Michigan In 2004 and 2007, the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) survey found that Comcast had the worst customer satisfaction rating of any company or government agency in the country, including the Internal Revenue Service. The ACSI indicates that almost half of all cable customers (regardless of company) have registered complaints, and that cable is the only industry to score below 60 in the ACSI. Comcast was given an ""F"" for its corporate governance practices in 2010, by Corporate Library, an independent shareholder-research organization. According to Corporate Library, Comcast's board of directors ability to oversee and control management was severely compromised (at least in 2010) by the fact that several of the directors either worked for the company or had business ties to it (making them susceptible to management pressure), and a third of the directors were over 70 years of age. According to the Wall Street Journal nearly two-thirds of the flights of Comcast's $40 million corporate jet purchased for business travel related to the NBCU acquisition, were to CEO Brian Roberts' private homes or to resorts. ^ ""February 11, 2004 filing of Comcast history from the Comcast website pursuant with Security Exchange Commission requirements.

Its name changed to The Detroit Savings Bank in 1871 and to The Detroit Bank in 1936, being one of the few area banks to survive the Great Depression. In 1956, the company merged with Birmingham National Bank, Ferndale National Bank and Detroit Wabeek Bank and Trust Company to form The Detroit Bank &amp; Trust Company. In 1971, it formed a holding company, DetroitBank Corporation. The current name was adopted in 1982. In 1982, the company entered the Florida market. In 1983, it acquired its hometown rival, Bank of the Commonwealth. It entered the Texas market in 1988 when it acquired Grand Bancshares. It added the California market in 1991 when it purchased Plaza Commerce Bancorp and InBancshares. In 1992, it merged with another large Detroit-based bank, Manufacturers National Corporation. Both banks were approximately the same size in assets ($14.3 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively) and employees (7,000 and 6,000). The merged bank announced its headquarters would be in the newly constructed Comerica Tower at Detroit Center in downtown Detroit in 1993. Comerica had previously maintained offices in the Detroit Savings Bank Building and Comerica Tower while Manufacturers Bank occupied space in Tower 200 of Renaissance Center. In 1996, the company sold its Illinois operation, which it acquired as part of its merger with Manufacturers, to LaSalle Bank. In 2000, the bank sold its credit card division to MBNA. In 2001, it acquired Imperial Bank of California, which also had branches in Arizona. In 1998, the company purchased the naming rights to the baseball stadium in downtown Detroit, home to the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball. It is to pay $66 million over a period of thirty years for the naming rights to Comerica Park. In October, 2002, Comerica Inc. announced to restate its second-quarter earnings to account for a $213 million charge, to cover climbing loan losses and a decline in the value of its Munder Capital Management unit. In January 2008, the company was selected by the U.S. Department of the Treasury as the financial agent for its Direct Express debit-card program. On January 18, 2011, it announced the acquisition of Houston-based Sterling Bank (Texas) for $1.03 billion, strengthening Comerica's presence in the Lone Star State. The acquisition virtually tripled its market share in Houston, provided it entry into the San Antonio and Kerrville regions, and complemented its banking center network in Dallas/Fort Worth. In August 2011, the company consolidated its Detroit operations into the 411 Building, vacating One Detroit Center. The 411 Building is the former headquarters of Manufacturers Bank."
ConAgra_Foods_Inc.," This article's lead section may not adequately summarize key points of its contents. Please consider expanding the lead to provide an accessible overview of all important aspects of the article. Please discuss this issue on the article's talk page. (July 2015) ConAgra Foods, Inc. ConAgra Foods headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska. Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;CAG S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Food processing Founded 1919 as Nebraska Consolidated Mills 1971 as ConAgra Foods Headquarters Omaha, Nebraska, U.S. Key people Sean Connolly President &amp; CEO Products Packaged foods Revenue US$17.7 Billion (2014) Number of employees 26,100 (2012) by Frank Little and Alva Kinney, who brought together four grain mills as Nebraska Consolidated Mills (NCM) with its headquarters in Grand Island, Nebraska. The headquarters were moved to Omaha in 1922. The company ran at a profit until 1936, when Kinney retired. In 1940, the company began producing flour at its own mill, and in 1942 ventured into the livestock feed business. That year president R.S. Dickinson opened the company's first out-of-state facility in Alabama with a flour mill and animal feed plant. After researching new uses for its flour, NCM funded the establishment of the Duncan Hines brand of cake mixes in 1951 as a way to market more flour. This venture was very successful, leading the company to its current place as the third largest flour miller in the U.S. However, this did not lead NCM to consider other food ventures, and instead it sold its assets in Duncan Hines to Procter &amp; Gamble in 1956. As American households purchased more and more prepared and instant foods in the 1950s and 1960s, NCM chose not to expand into the businesses that used its flour, instead turning in the opposite direction and focusing more on raw foods like poultry and expanding its livestock feed business. In 1971, Nebraska Consolidated Mills changed its name to ""ConAgra"", a portmanteau of con for consolidated and agra, similarly short in English for agriculture. The 1970s brought the company to the brink of ruin as it lost money expanding into the fertilizer, catfish, and pet product industries and as commodity speculation wiped out ConAgra's margins on raw foods. In 1974, C. Michael ""Mike"" Harper, an experienced food industry executive, took over the firm and brought it back from the brink of bankruptcy. Nonetheless, ConAgra's business model left it vulnerable to volatile commodity prices. In response, the company set off on a two-decade-long buying spree, purchasing over one hundred prepared food brands, starting with its 1980 purchase of Banquet Foods. It moved heavily into the frozen food business and the packaged meat industry, and then picked up a selection of other brands from firms like RJR Nabisco and Beatrice Foods among others, as the leveraged buyouts of the 1980s resulted in the divestiture or breakup of many major American consumer product firms. In 1993 alone it purchased $500 million in smaller firms, and in 1998 it purchased another $480 million in brands from Nabisco. On May 23, 2001, ConAgra Foods Inc said it would restate its earnings for 1998, 1999 and 2000, due to accounting and conduct matters at its United Agri Products Cos unit. For fiscal 1998, revenues was cut from $24.27 billion to $24.19 billion. Main article: List of ConAgra brands ConAgra produces a wide array of food products including cooking oil, frozen dinners, hot cocoa, hot dogs, peanut butter and many others. Some of ConAgra's major brands include Hunt's, Healthy Choice, Marie Callender's, Orville Redenbacher, Slim Jim (snack food), Reddi-wip, Egg Beaters, Hebrew National, P. F. Chang's, and Bertolli ready meals. Partnership with Feeding America against child hunger In 2003–2004, ConAgra participated in a Minnesota Pollution Control Agency voluntary investigation and clean-up program. Through the program, the company cleaned up a property previously used for lithium ore processing and constructed a new 80,000-square-foot (7,000&#160;m2) office/warehouse building. In May 2003, ConAgra and its subsidiary Gilroy Foods agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle charges of hiring discrimination brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The charges involved a July 1999 Teamsters strike at a plant in King City, California, then owned by Basic Vegetable Products LP but later purchased by ConAgra. In August 2001, the company negotiated with the union an end to the two-year strike with a new contract that would recall workers based on seniority. However, the recall process excluded workers who were on leave at the time of the purchase including those out due to work injury or pregnancy. Others were denied jobs due to a history of previous injury or illness, despite their having no restrictions on returning to work. According to the EEOC, most of the 39 workers who were excluded from the recall process had been working at the plant for 10 to 30 years and were primarily Hispanic and female. The organization's goal was to oppose the California citizen's initiative, known as Proposition 37, demanding mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients. Although the proposition was defeated, there was strong consumer backlash against the coalition's opposition. Consumer advocates encouraged nationwide boycotts of coalition members, and movements were started in several other states to enact similar labeling requirements. As a result, ConAgra and others in the Coalition met with Walmart (the largest food retailer in the U.S.) to seek a nationwide labeling system for genetically modified foods, instead of trying to defeat the measures in every state. In February 2007, ConAgra recalled jars of Peter Pan and Great Value brand peanut butter with the product code ""2111"" on the lid, because they were linked to a Salmonella outbreak. Ultimately, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) documented more than 628 individuals who were stricken with salmonella poisoning in 47 states that could be traced back to Peter Pan and Great Value peanut butter. Of those, 20% were hospitalized, according to the CDC, which reported no deaths associated with the outbreak. Since Peter Pan (but not Great Value) is only made at one plant, the recall included all Peter Pan jars sold in the U.S. between May 2006 and February 2007. As of August 2007, 39 lawsuits had been filed against ConAgra, seeking a total of more than $5 million in damages for doctor bills, hospital stays, and lost wages stemming from the contaminated food."

Following the September 11 attacks, the 15th Street exit from the FDR Drive, announced by the sign on the right, was permanently closed. Consolidated Edison, Inc., commonly known as Con Edison or Con Ed, is one of the largest investor-owned energy companies in the United States, with approximately $13 billion in annual revenues as of 2010, and over $36 billion in assets. The company provides a wide range of energy-related products and services to its customers through its subsidiaries: Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., (CECONY), a regulated utility providing electric, gas, and steam service in New York City and Westchester County, New York; Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc., a regulated utility serving customers in a 1,350-square-mile (3,500&#160;km2) area in southeastern New York and adjacent sections of northern New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania; Con Edison Solutions, a retail energy supply and services company; Con Edison Energy, a wholesale energy supply company; and Con Edison Development, a company that owns and operates generating plants and participates in other infrastructure projects. In 2014, electric revenues accounted for 70.54% of consolidated sales (70.84 in 2013); gas revenues 14.96% (14.74%); steam revenues 4.86% (5.52%); and non-utility revenues 9.62% (8.85%). Con Edison’s electric business also dates back to 1882, when Thomas Edison’s Edison Illuminating Company of New York began supplying electricity to 59 customers in a square-mile area in lower Manhattan. After the “War of Currents”, there were more than 30 companies generating and distributing electricity in New York City and Westchester County. But by 1920 there were far fewer, and the New York Edison Company (then part of Consolidated Gas) was clearly the leader. In 1936, with electric sales far outstripping gas sales, the company incorporated and the name was changed to Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. The years that followed brought further amalgamations as Consolidated Edison acquired or merged with more than a dozen companies between 1936 and 1960. Con Edison today is the result of acquisitions, dissolutions and mergers of more than 170 individual electric, gas and steam companies. On January 1, 1998, following the deregulation of the utility industry in New York state, a holding company, Consolidated Edison, Inc., was formed. It is one of the nation’s largest investor-owned energy companies, with approximately $14 billion in annual revenues and $33 billion in assets. The company provides a wide range of energy-related products and services to its customers through two regulated utility subsidiaries and three competitive energy businesses. Under a number of corporate names, the company has been traded on the NYSE without interruption since 1824—longer than any other NYSE stock. Its largest subsidiary, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. provides electric, gas and steam service to more than 3 million customers in New York City and Westchester County, New York, an area of 660 square miles (1,700&#160;km2) with a population of nearly 9 million. Systems The Con Edison electrical transmission system utilizes voltages of 138 kilovolts (kV), 345 kV, and 500 kV. The company has two 345 kV interconnections with upstate New York that enable it to import power from Hydro-Québec in Canada and one 345 kV interconnection each with Public Service Electric and Gas in New Jersey and LIPA on Long Island. Con Edison is also interconnected with Public Service Electric and Gas via the Branchburg-Ramapo 500 kV line. Con Ed's distribution voltages are 33 kV, 27 kV, 13 kV, and 4 kV. The 93,000 miles (150,000&#160;km) of underground cable in the Con Edison system could wrap around the Earth 3.6 times. Nearly 36,000 miles (58,000&#160;km) of overhead electric wires complement the underground system—enough cable to stretch between New York and Los Angeles 13 times. The Con Edison gas system has nearly 7,200 miles (11,600&#160;km) of pipes—if laid end to end, long enough to reach Paris and back to New York City, and serves Westchester County, the Bronx, Manhattan and parts of Queens. Gas service in the other boroughs is provided by National Grid USA. The average volume of gas that travels through Con Edison’s gas system annually could fill the Empire State Building nearly 6,100 times. Main article: New York City steam system Con Edison produces 30 billion pounds of steam each year through its seven power plants which boil water to 1,000&#160;°F (538&#160;°C) before pumping it to hundreds of buildings in the New York City steam system, which is the biggest district steam system in the world. Main article: Avatar Studios A former Con Edison building on West 53rd Street in Manhattan was converted first into the studio for the television game show Let's Make a Deal, and later into a recording studio called “The Power Station” because of its Edison history. In 1996, the studio was renamed Avatar Studios."

In June 2013 the company, which formerly imported Corona and other Modelo brands to the United States, acquired the US rights to those brands as a part of an anti-trust settlement permitting Modelo's acquisition by Anheuser-Busch InBev, along with a brewery in Piedras Negras, Mexico. It now produces its own versions of those products for the US, with Modelo serving all other countries.

While these restrictions are posted in the store they are not applied rigorously; in reality any individual may apply for, and receive, a membership card. In the U.S., as of May 2015, membership fees at Costco are US$55 per year for a Gold Star (individual) or Business membership, which can be upgraded to an Executive membership for an additional US$55 per year. and members can load them with money to make non-cash purchases at all Costco warehouses in Australia and the United States. Because Costco gas stations take only American Express, Costco Cash, Costco credit cards, debit cards, and MasterCard (Canadian locations only), people who can only pay for gas by check or cash must purchase a Costco Cash Card before filling up. A Costco membership is not required to make purchases with a Costco Cash Card. A non-member may not purchase or re-load a Costco Cash Card; however, they may spend more than the total value of their cash card in-store provided they pay in cash or approved debit cards for the remaining balance. At Costco stores and gas stations, until June 19th, 2016, American Express is the only accepted credit card in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, because Amex charges Costco very low interchange fees (a percentage of revenue from total sales made); as Costco's margins are low in comparison to other retailers'. Other forms of payment accepted at Canadian, United Kingdom, and United States Costco locations include cash, Costco Cash Cards, Costco credit cards, checks, EBT cards (food stamps), and PIN-based debit cards (Interac in Canada). Costco also accepts Flexible spending account (FSA) debit cards for qualifying purchases at the optical and pharmacy departments in the U.S. Costco guarantees almost all of their products with a full refund. Exceptions include cameras, camcorders, cellular phones, computers, digital audio players, projectors, and televisions; these may be returned within 90 days of purchase for a refund, for any reason. After 90 days those returns must be done through the manufacturer according to the terms of the warranty. Also excepted are tires (which are covered by their manufacturer's separate defects and treadware warranties) and batteries (which are covered by a 36/100-month warranty, where they may be replaced for free in the first 30 months and are covered under a pro-rated warranty for months 31-85). Costco has negotiated with manufacturers to extend the manufacturer's warranty to two years for new computers and televisions (five years on televisions sold by Costco in the UK). Over the years, Costco has gradually expanded its range of products and services. Initially, it preferred to sell only boxed products that could be dispensed by simply tearing the stretch wrap off a pallet. It now sells many other products that are more difficult to handle, such as art, books, caskets, clothing, computer software, fine wine, furniture home appliances, home electronics, hot tubs, jewelry, perishable items (such as dairy, fresh baked goods, flowers, fresh produce, meat, seafood), solar panels, tires, and vacuums. Many warehouses also have gas stations, pharmacies, hearing aid centers, optometrists, photo processors, and tire garages. Some locations have liquor stores, often kept separate from the main warehouse in order to comply with liquor license restrictions. In some states (such as Texas), the liquor store must be owned and operated by a separate company with separate employees. features articles which regularly tie into the corporation along with business, celebrity features, cooking, entertaining, health, home improvement, and social articles, as well as coupons and ads. MediaPost reports: ""While about 90% of the magazine’s advertising is co-op, increasingly national advertisers such as Procter &amp; Gamble are buying space, notes Roeglin -- presumably because of the pub’s gargantuan reach and the data it has on its subscribers (whose average household income is $156,000 a year). 'We see about 56% of our subscribers a month buy something at one of our stores based on something they've read in the magazine,' says Roeglin."" Costco regularly teams up with various automobile manufacturers to offer special deals to customers, e.g., Polaris (a leading seller of powersport vehicles) in 4Q2015 On March 9, 2005, NOVA Information Systems (NOVA) partnered with Costco to market and support payment processing services to Costco Canada's Business Executive Members. The program is marketed directly to Costco members through various Costco avenues, including the Travel Guide to Savings (found in all U.S. Costco warehouses) and in the Travel section of Costco.com. but the menu is essentially the same, offering a quarter-pound 100% beef hot dog or Polish sausage and 20 fl. oz. (591 ml) drink (with refills) for US$1.50, the same price since 1985. In Australia, the hot dog is made of pork and is sold at AUD$1.99 with large soda. In Canada, the price for a hot dog and a 20 fl. oz. (591 ml)-size soda with refills is C$1.50. In Mexico, the hot dog is made of pork and includes a drink (with refills) for Mex$ 30. In the UK, the hot dog is also made from beef; customers can also get a drink (with refills) for £1.50. Costco sold more than 82 million quarter-pound (113 g) hot dogs in its food courts in 2008. Frozen yogurt is also served in chocolate, vanilla, or swirled together. Also offered are berry smoothies, latte freeze (without chocolate), mocha freeze (with chocolate), beef bake, chicken bake, On April 17, 2001, Costco Wholesale opened a B2B (Business to Business) online shopping site at costco.com for faster and easier business shopping. Product-demonstration (e.g., food samples) employees work for an outside company. In the western U.S., the company is called Warehouse Demo Services, Kirkland, Washington. Map of Costco warehouses in the US (August 2010). As of December 14, 2015 As of April 19, 2015, Costco Spain has a message on their Costco.es website which states (in Spanish): ""Costco will arrive in Madrid very soon"", which might indicate expansion plans for the company. The business center is not as big as the regular warehouse. The size of the building averages 115,000 square feet whereas the regular warehouse averages 150,000 square feet. The entire site of the business center also isn't as big. The site only averages 10–12 acres (4.0–4.9&#160;ha), whereas the regular warehouse averages 14–16 acres (5.7–6.5&#160;ha). The business center will only have 300-350 parking spaces, compared to the regular warehouse that has at least 750 parking spaces. Also, the traffic at the business center is not as huge as the regular warehouse is. There are typically 1,000 customers per day at the business center, where the regular warehouse has 6,000-8,000 customers per day. 50% of the sales volume is done by delivery, and the average sale per member is $300 at the business center vs $100 at the regular warehouse. The business center has stalls of on-site truck parking, but the regular warehouse doesn't. The business center has 4 inbound and 5 outbound loading docks, and the regular warehouse has 5 inbound and no outbound loading docks. There are also 20 inbound and 30 outbound truck trips per day at the business center, and the regular warehouse has 25 inbound and no outbound truck trips. There are also not as many carts at the business center. There are 200 regular carts and 50 flatbeds at the business center, whereas the regular warehouse has 700 regular carts and 100 flatbeds. The flatbeds at the business center have a basked attached to them to keep track of smaller items. Who Has Food Courts and/or Gas Stations As of March 2016, there are 13 Costco Business Centers, located in Phoenix, Arizona; California (Commerce, Hawthorne, Hayward, San Diego, and Westminster); Morrow, Georgia; Bedford Park, Illinois; Hackensack, New Jersey; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Washington (Lynnwood, and Fife). The company cited cutbacks in consumer spending on home products and its interest in focusing on its core business as the main reasons."

It had over 65 million plan members as of mid-2014. With net revenue of approximately $76 billion in 2013, they are also one of the largest PBMs. Caremark operates a national retail pharmacy network with over 68,000 participating pharmacies, as well as 11 mail service pharmacies. Its call centers have been recognized for customer satisfaction excellence by J.D. Power &amp; Associates (J.D. Power &amp; Associates is also a client of Caremark). Caremark operates over 25 retail specialty pharmacies, and its specialty pharmacies have been accredited by the Joint Commission. Its disease management programs through Accordant(R) have also been accredited by the National Committee for Quality Assurance. CVS/specialty is the specialty pharmacy division that provides an array of specialty pharmacy services for patients who require treatment for rare, incurable or complex conditions. Name Caremark was established by James M. Sweeney in 1979, as Home Health Care of America (HHCA), incorporated in Delaware, with corporate headquarters in Irvine, California. The first office was opened in Beachwood, Ohio, with four employees, in conjunction with Ezra Steiger, of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Steiger's Hyperalimentation Team worked closely to provide supplies at home for their parenteral therapy patients. Satellite offices were subsequently opened in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Houston, Chicago, and Irvine. HHCA changed its name to Caremark in 1985. In 1987, Caremark was acquired by Baxter International. In 1991 when Caremark was Baxter International's home infusion subsidiary, Caremark was accused by the United States government of ""paying doctors to steer patients to its intravenous drug service.""

(January 2013) The first CVS store, selling health and beauty products, was founded in Lowell, Mass. by brothers Stanley and Sidney Goldstein and Scandinavian American Ralph Hoagland in 1963. In 1964, CVS had 17 stores that sold primarily health and beauty products. In 1967, CVS began operation of its first stores with pharmacy departments, opening locations in Warwick and Cumberland, R.I. In 1969, CVS was sold to Melville Corporation. By 1970, CVS operated 100 stores in New England and the Northeast. In 1972, CVS nearly doubled in size with its acquisition of 84 Clinton Drug and Discount Stores. The purchase introduced CVS to the Midwest with stores in Indiana. In 1977, CVS acquired the 36-store New Jersey–based Mack Drug chain. In 1980, CVS became the 15th largest pharmacy chain in the U.S. with 408 stores and $414 million in sales. In 1988, CVS celebrated its 25th anniversary, finishing the year with nearly 750 stores and sales of about $1.6 billion. Since 1990, CVS has been rapidly growing in order to become a national drug store chain. In 1990, CVS acquired 500-store Peoples Drug, which established the company in new mid-Atlantic markets including Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. Peoples Drug stores were converted into CVS stores in May 1994. In 1994, CVS launched PharmaCare, a pharmacy benefit management (PBM) company providing a wide range of services to employers, managed care organizations, insurance companies, unions and government agencies. Most of the former Eckerd stores that CVS purchased (and converted into CVS stores) were in Florida and Texas. Since JCPenney credit cards were accepted at Eckerd drugs stores, they have been continued to be used at CVS. Also in 2004, CVS ProCare became part of PharmaCare. All ProCare stores were re-branded as PharmaCare stores. On January 23, 2006, CVS announced that it had agreed to acquire the freestanding drug store operations of supermarket chain Albertsons. Transition of Sav-On and Osco stores to the CVS brand began shortly thereafter, and was completed by December 2006. CVS now dominates the Southern California market. Also included were Albertsons Health'n'Home (now CVS Home Health) durable medical equipment (DME) stores. Approximately 28 CVS Home Health locations are present in Arizona, California and the Kansas City area, representing CVS' first venture into the specialized DME market. CVS had previously operated stores in southern California and completely withdrew from the market in 1993. CVS sold virtually all the locations to American Drug Stores, the drug store division of American Stores Company. American Stores operated its drug stores in southern California as Sav-on Drugs. Ironically, many of the stores in Southern California that CVS acquired were stores that CVS had formerly owned. At the time CVS bought the stores back, Sav-on operated them as Sav-on Express stores. The Express name was used by Sav-on to help customers identify those stores that did not carry all lines of merchandise as compared to the larger traditional Sav-on Drugs location, hence the name Sav-on Express. As a result of the acquisition, the chain now operates over 6,200 stores in 43 states and the District of Columbia. On July 13, 2006, CVS announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Minneapolis-based MinuteClinic, the pioneer and largest provider of retail-based health clinics in the U.S. MinuteClinic operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of CVS Corporation. MinuteClinic health care centers are staffed by board-certified nurse practitioners and physician assistants who are trained to diagnose, treat and provide prescriptions (when clinically appropriate) for common family illnesses such as strep throat and ear, eye, sinus, bladder and bronchial infections. MinuteClinic also offers common vaccinations, such as flu shots, tetanus, and Hepatitis A &amp; B. The clinics are also supported by physicians who collaborate with the nurse practitioners to assure the highest quality of care. CVS plans to have 400 MinuteClinics by the end of 2007, most of which within CVS/pharmacy locations, and are targeting a total of about 2,500. The pharmacy services business, including the combined pharmacy benefits management (PBM), specialty pharmacy, and disease management businesses, is headquartered in Nashville, TN. Tom Ryan, the Chairman &amp; CEO of CVS remained president and CEO of CVS Caremark Corporation, while Caremark's Edwin Crawford became the Chairman of the Board. Since 1978, CVS Samaritan Vans have provided free roadside assistance to motorists and the community in numerous cities. They are ""emergency response vehicles"" that patrol select major freeways of Chicago, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Boston, Detroit, Indianapolis, Providence and Washington, D.C. in search of motorists in need. The drivers have a multitude of talents and certifications. They are Nationally Certified Auto Mechanics, State Certified Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) or Paramedics, and Nationally Certified Animal Control Officers. They are capable of making numerous on-site auto repairs, administering medical help, calming a tense situation or using their communication equipment to summon the state police or other assistance. Each year, the CVS Samaritan Vans travel about 600,000 miles (970,000&#160;km), checking and assisting nearly 50,000 people, and responding to more than 61,000 roadway incidents. Played at the Rhode Island Country Club, the CVS Caremark Charity Classic was established to raise money for the support of non-profit agencies throughout New England. Since 1999, it has raised over $8 million for charity. The event has featured golf legends such as Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Hale Irwin, and Gary Player along with today's top stars like David Duval, Chris DiMarco, Davis Love III, &amp; Scott McCarron. In 1998, the Washington Post reported that CVS Corporation appeared to be sharing prescription drug information with the Woburn, Massachusetts, based marketing company, Elensys. According to the Post, Elensys received information on specific prescription drugs that individual CVS customers had purchased and used this information to send targeted direct mailings urging customers to renew prescriptions and promoting other products in which they might be interested. CVS and Elensys argued that there were no privacy issues because Elensys was acting solely as a contractor to CVS, and because the purpose of the mailings was to educate consumers. CVS claimed that it never shared customers' medical histories with Elensys (despite the Washington Post's indirect evidence that they had). George D. Lundberg, editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association, called the practice ""a gross invasion"" of privacy. Following a firestorm of criticism and complaints by consumers, CVS discontinued the relationship with Elensys, and moved the practice in-house. During 2005, a series of prescription mistakes came to light in some of CVS Corporation's Boston-area stores. An investigation confirmed 62 errors or quality problems going back to 2002. In February 2006, the state Board of Pharmacy announced that the non-profit Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) would monitor all Massachusetts stores for the next two years. In 2005, Caremark Rx paid $137.5 million to settle federal lawsuits filed by whistle-blowers that accused a company it acquired in 2003 of improper dealings with pharmaceutical manufacturers. The lawsuits said that the acquired company, AdvancePCS, accepted kickbacks from drug makers to promote their products over those of rivals under contracts with government programs including the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, the Mail Handlers Health Benefit Program and Medicare health maintenance plans. There was no admission of wrongdoing by Caremark or AdvancePCS. CVS Caremark Corp. has changed their practices. The formulary revision process considers manufacturer rebates, payments from drug manufacturers for low placement on PBM formularies, along with average wholesale price (AWP), drug availability, and bulk discounts when choosing at which co-pay a brand name drug should be placed. The attorneys general, led by Lisa Madigan (D) of Illinois and Douglas Ganslar (D) of Maryland, allege that Caremark ""engaged in deceptive business practices"" by informing physicians that patients or health plans could save money if patients were switched to certain brand-name prescription drugs (Miller, Chicago Tribune, 2/14). However, the switch often saved patients and health plans only small amounts or increased their costs, while increasing Caremark's profits, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal (D) said (Levick, Hartford Courant, 2/15). Pennsylvania Attorney General Tom Corbett (R) said the PBM kept discounts and rebates that should have been passed on to employers and patients (Levy, AP/San Francisco Chronicle, 2/14). In addition, Caremark did not ""adequately inform doctors"" of the full financial effect of the switch and did not disclose that the switch would increase Caremark's profits, the lawsuit alleges (Chicago Tribune, 2/14). ...The settlement prohibits CVS from requesting prescription drug switches in certain cases, such as when the cost to the patient would be higher with the new prescription drug; when the original prescription drug's patent will expire within six months; and when patients were switched from a similar prescription drug within the previous two years (Hartford Courant, 2/15). Patients also have the ability to decline a switch from the prescribed treatment to the prescription offered by the pharmacy under the settlement, Madigan said (Bloomberg News/Philadelphia Inquirer, 2/15). On May 4, 2010, CVS Caremark Corp. announced that its business practices were being investigated by a group of 24 states, along with the District of Columbia and Los Angeles County. At issue is the post-merger relationship between CVS and Caremark. In addition, the company had earlier acknowledged in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that it had received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, requiring the company to provide information regarding the incentives the company provides to customers who transfer their prescriptions to CVS, including gift cards, goods and other incentives. On February 18, 2009, CVS Caremark agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it failed to take reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect the sensitive financial and medical information of its customers and employees, in violation of federal law. In a separate but related agreement, the company’s pharmacy chain also has agreed to pay $2.25 million to resolve Department of Health and Human Services allegations that it violated the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)."

What would come to be known as Darden Restaurants began when William (Bill) Darden, age 19, opened his first restaurant, The Green Frog, in Waycross, Georgia, in 1938. He later founded the Red Lobster Inns of America and opened the first Red Lobster restaurant in Lakeland, Florida, in 1968. General Mills upgraded the chain to a more casual dining/family fare oriented format, opened a new company headquarters in Orlando and retained Darden as company manager. In 1975, when Darden was promoted to the position of Vice President at General Mills, Joseph (Joe) R. Lee, the company's first restaurant manager, was made President of Red Lobster. Under General Mills, Red Lobster grew into a chain of almost 400 locations by 1985. The company underwent several restructurings and transformed itself from an inexpensive fast-food seller into a chain of casual dining seafood restaurants by 1988. In 1990, China Coast was launched as an attempt to create a (U.S.) national casual dining restaurant that featured American Chinese cuisine. While the chain eventually expanded to some 50 restaurants, its sales were lackluster and lost an estimated $20 million USD. By the end of 1995, the company was shuttered, and the remaining locations were either converted to Red Lobsters or Olive Gardens or closed altogether. Starboard assembled its own slate of directors to challenge all the sitting board members in the company's upcoming shareholder elections. In support of their candidacy it released a 294-slide presentation in early September about how the company had gone wrong and how its directors would restore it to health. While it received considerable media attention for its detailed focus on Olive Garden, in particular the chain's ""wasteful"" practice of serving too many of its free unlimited breadsticks at once (to prevent food waste due to staleness: instead of one per customer plus an additional one per table; additional breadsticks are served fresh on demand) and not salting the water it boiled pasta in so as to secure a longer warranty on the pots, it also attacked management for spending lavishly on the chain's corporate headquarters while paying the general managers of individual restaurants less than its competitors did.

(June 2013) Deere &amp; Company John Deere World Headquarters in Moline, Illinois Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;DE S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Heavy equipment Founded Grand Detour, Illinois (1837&#160;(1837)) Founder John Deere Headquarters Moline, Illinois, United States Area served Worldwide Key people Sam Allen (CEO and President) Products Agriculture, Construction, Forestry, Consumer &amp; Commercial equipment, Diesel engines, Automobiles Services Financial services Revenue US$37.795 billion (2013) Operating income US$5.415 billion (2013) Net income US$3.537 billion (2013) Total assets US$59.521 billion (2013) Total equity US$10.267 billion (2013) Number of employees 67,000 (2013) Website www.deere.com Deere &amp; Company (brand name John Deere) is an American corporation that manufactures agricultural, construction, and forestry machinery, diesel engines, drivetrains (axles, transmissions, gearboxes) used in heavy equipment, and lawn care equipment. In 2014, it was listed as 80th in the Fortune 500 America's ranking and was ranked 307th in the Fortune Global 500 ranking in 2013. Deere &amp; Company began when John Deere, born in Rutland, Vermont, USA on February 7, 1804, moved to Grand Detour, Illinois in 1836 in order to escape bankruptcy in Vermont. Already an established blacksmith, Deere opened a 1,378 square feet (128&#160;m2) shop in Grand Detour in 1837 which allowed him to serve as a general repairman in the village, as well as a manufacturer of small tools such as pitchforks and shovels. Small tools was just a start, the item that set him apart, was the self-scouring steel plow, which was pioneered in 1837 when John Deere fashioned a Scottish steel saw blade into a plow. Prior to Deere's steel plow, most farmers used iron or wooden plows that the rich Midwestern soil stuck to and had to be cleaned frequently. The smooth sided steel plow solved this problem, and greatly aided migration into the American Great Plains in the 19th and early 20th century. The traditional way of doing business was to make the product as and when it was ordered. This style was very slow and as Deere realized that this wasn’t going to be a viable business model so he increased the rate of production by manufacturing plows before putting them up for sale, this allowed customers to not only see what they were buying beforehand but allowed his customers to purchase his products straight away. Word of his products began to spread quickly. In 1842, Deere entered a business partnership with Leonard Andrus and purchased land for the construction of a new two-story factory along the Rock River in Illinois. This factory, named the ""L. Andrus Plough Manufacturer"", produced about 100 plows in 1842 and approximately 400 plows during the next year. Deere's partnership with Andrus ended in 1848, and Deere relocated to Moline, Illinois in order to have access to the railroad and the Mississippi River. There, Deere formed a partnership with Robert Tate and John Gould and built a 1,440 square feet (134&#160;m2) factory the same year. Production rose quickly, and by 1849, the Deere, Tate &amp; Gould Company was producing over 200 plows a month. A two story addition to the plant was built, allowing further production. Logo of the company used between 1876 and 1912 Deere bought out Tate and Gould's interests in the company in 1853, and was joined in the business by his son Charles Deere. At that time, the company was manufacturing a variety of farm equipment products in addition to plows; including wagons, corn planters and cultivators. In 1857, the company's production totals reached almost 1,120 implements per month. In 1858, a nationwide financial recession took a toll on the company. To prevent bankruptcy, the company was reorganized and Deere sold his interests in the business to his son in law, Christopher Webber, and his son, Charles Deere, who would take on most of his father's managerial roles. John Deere served as president of the company until 1886. The company was reorganized again in 1868, when it was incorporated as Deere &amp; Company. While the company's original stockholders were Charles Deere, Stephen Velie, George Vinton, and John Deere, Charles effectively ran the company. In 1869, Charles began to introduce marketing centers and independent retail dealers to advance the company's sales nationwide. This same year, Deere &amp; Company won ""Best and Greatest Display of Plows in Variety"" at the 17th Annual Illinois State Fair, for which it won $10 and a Silver Medal. John Deere Plow &amp; Cultivators Co.'s New Orleans House, 1903 Increased competition during the early 1900s from the new International Harvester Company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business, but it was the production of gasoline tractors which would come to define Deere &amp; Company's operations during the twentieth century. Logo of the company used between 1912 and 1936 In 1912, Deere &amp; Company president William Butterworth (Charles' son-in-law), who had replaced Charles Deere after his death in 1907, began the company's expansion into the tractor business. Deere &amp; Company briefly experimented with its own tractor models, the most successful of which was the Dain All-Wheel-Drive, but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company in 1918, which manufactured the popular Waterloo Boy tractor at its facilities in Waterloo, Iowa. Deere &amp; Company continued to sell tractors under the Waterloo Boy name until 1923, when the John Deere Model D was introduced. The company still manufactures most of its tractors in Waterloo, Iowa. The company produced its first combine harvester, the John Deere No. 2 in 1927. A year later, this innovation was followed up by the introduction of John Deere No. 1, a smaller, machine that was more popular with customers. By 1929, the No. 1 and No. 2 were replaced by newer, lighter-weight harvesters. In the 1930s John Deere and other farm equipment manufacturers began developing hillside harvesting technology. Harvesters now had the ability to effectively use their combines to harvest grain on hillsides with up to a 50% slope gradient. In 1956, Deere &amp; Company bought-out the German tractor manufacturer, Heinrich Lanz AG (see Lanz Bulldog). A John Deere-Lanz 700 tractor On August 30, 1960, John Deere dealers from around the world converged on Dallas, Texas for an unprecedented product showcase. Deere Day in Dallas, as the event was called, introduced the world to the ""New Generation of Power"", the company’s first modern four-cylinder and six-cylinder tractors, during a day packed with high-tech presentations, live demonstrations, and of course a parking lot full of brand-new green and yellow machines. The line of tractors introduced that day was five years in the making, and the event itself took months to plan. Deere chose Dallas to host the event partly because it was home to facilities large enough to accommodate the 6,000 guests and the equipment they were all there to see. The Dallas Memorial Auditorium, the Texas State Fairgrounds Coliseum, the Cotton Bowl, and the Cotton Bowl parking lot were each the site of part of the event. During the event a new John Deere tractor with a diamond-covered nameplate was displayed for all to see inside Neiman-Marcus a popular Dallas based department store. According to information released by the company at the time of the event, John Deere dealers and key employees came to Dallas via the ""largest commercial airlift of its type ever attempted."" During the 24 hours leading up to the event, 16 airlines brought Deere employees and sales people from all over the United States and Canada to Love Field in Dallas. Bill Hewitt, then chairman and CEO of Deere &amp; Company, welcomed the dealers and introduced the new tractors. Hewitt told the guests they were about to see ""a line of entirely new tractors – completely modern in every respect – with outstanding features not duplicated in any other make of tractor."" Since entering the tractor business in 1918 John Deere had focused on two-cylinder machines. The New Generation of Power introduced at Deere Day in Dallas was very different from anything Deere had built before. The new line of four-and six-cylinder tractors, the model 1010, 2010, 3010, and 4010 were more far more powerful than Deere's two cylinder models, and also easier and more comfortable to operate, with conveniently located controls, better visibility and improved seat suspension. These new tractors were also easier to service. In the 1962 Illinois Manufacturers Directory (50th anniversary edition), John Deere, listed as Deere and Company claimed a total work force of 35,000 of which 9,000 were in Illinois. The corporate headquarters were located at 1325 Third Ave. in Moline, IL with six manufacturing plants located around that city and a seventh plant in Hoopston, IL. The six plants in Moline were listed as follows: the John Deere Harvester Works at 1100 - 13th Ave., East Moline where 3,000 employees made agricultural implements. The John Deere Industrial Equipment Works at 301 Third Ave., Moline where 500 employees made earth moving equipment. The John Deere Malleable Works at 1335-13th Street, East Moline where 600 employees made malleable and nodular iron castings. The John Deere Planter Works at 501 Third ave., Moline where 1,000 employees made agricultural implements. The John Deere Plow Works at 1225 Third Ave., Moline where 1,100 employees made agricultural implements. The sixth plant was the John Deere Spreader Works at 1209-13th Ave., Moline where 800 employees made agricultural implements. The John Deere Vermilion Works was located at North Sixth Ave., Hoopston, Illinois where 140 employees were listed as making iron work; implement parts. Moline with 42,705 residents in 1962 saw the local 7,000 employees of John Deere represent 16% of the city's entire population. In 1969 John Deere followed its New Generation tractors of the 1960s with a ""New Generation"" of combines. These included the 3300, 4400, 6600 and 7700. These models were also the first to come with Quik-Tatch header mounting capabilities as standard equipment. In the 1980s these combines were followed by the 4420, 6620, 7720, 8820 that were essentially updated and improved versions of the previous models with larger capacity, a nicer cab, and easier maintenance and service. In the late 1970s International Harvester had pioneered rotary combines with their Axial flow machines, but Deere continued to build only conventional walker combines through the 1980s and into the 1990s. In 1999 John Deere introduced the Single-Tine Separation (STS) system on its 9650 and 9750 Maximizer combines, representing a step forward in rotary combine technology. The STS system uses less horsepower and improves material handling. This section is incomplete.

(""Delta""; NYSE:&#160;DAL) is a major American airline, with its headquarters and largest hub at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia. Regional service is operated under the brand name Delta Connection. Delta is the sixth-oldest operating airline by foundation date, and the oldest airline still operating in the United States. The company's history can be traced back to Huff Daland Dusters, founded in 1924 in Macon, Georgia as a crop dusting operation. The company moved to Monroe, Louisiana, and was later renamed Delta Air Services, in reference to the nearby Mississippi Delta region, and commenced passenger services on June 17, 1929. Among predecessors of today's Delta Air Lines, Western Airlines and Northwest Airlines began flying passengers in 1926 and 1927, respectively. In 2013, Delta Air Lines was the world's largest airline in terms of scheduled passengers carried (120.6 million), and the second-largest in terms of both revenue passenger-kilometers flown (277.6 billion) and capacity (4.4 billion ASM/week; March 2013).

Delta Air Lines was created as Huff Daland Dusters, Incorporated, an aerial crop dusting operation, on May 30, 1924 in Macon, Georgia. Formed with a Huff-Daland Duster, the first true crop duster, the plane was deployed to combat the boll weevil in 1925. Delta Air Corporation owned the plane (now in the Southern Museum of Flight). The company moved to Monroe, Louisiana, in 1925. Collett E. Woolman, one of the original directors, purchased the company on September 13, 1928, and renamed it Delta Air Service. It began carrying passengers on June 17, 1929. The single passenger sat in a chair placed in the bin where the pesticide was usually kept. A Northwest Airlines Airbus A330-300, shortly before the merger with Delta in 2008 The current Delta Air Lines is the result of many airline mergers over a period of more than 80 years. The most recent merger was with Northwest Airlines on October 29, 2008 and at the time formed the world's largest airline. After approval of the merger, Northwest continued to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta until December 31, 2009 when both carriers' operating certificates were merged (the Delta certificate was kept). Predecessor carriers forming the current Delta Air Lines include: Chicago and Southern Air Lines (formed in 1933, merged into Delta in 1953). Northeast Airlines (formed in 1931, merged into Delta in August 1972) Northwest Airlines (formed in 1926, merged into Delta in 2010. Also known as Northwest Orient Airlines from 1950-1986) Republic Airlines (formed in 1979, merged into Northwest Airlines in 1986) Hughes Airwest (formed in 1968 as Air West, name change to Hughes Airwest in 1970, merged into Republic Airlines in 1980) Bonanza Air Lines (formed in 1945, merged into Hughes Airwest (Air West) in 1968) Pacific Air Lines (formed in 1941, merged into Hughes Airwest (Air West) in 1968) West Coast Airlines (formed in 1941, merged into Hughes Airwest (Air West) in 1968) North Central Airlines (formed in 1944 as Wisconsin Central Airlines, name change to North Central Airlines in 1952, merged into Republic Airlines in 1979) Southern Airways (formed in 1944, merged into Republic Airlines in 1979) Pan American World Airways (formed in 1927, upon its bankruptcy in 1991 Delta bought a selection of Pan Am's assets and routes and merged them into its operations) Atlantic, Gulf, and Caribbean Airways (formed in 1927, merged into Pan American World Airways in 1928) American Overseas Airlines (formed in 1937, merged into Pan American World Airways in 1950) Aviation Corporation of the Americas/American International Airways (formed in 1926, merged into Pan American World Airways in 1928) National Airlines (formed in 1934, merged into Pan American World Airways in 1980) Western Airlines (formed in 1925, merged into Delta in 1987) Standard Air Lines (formed in 1927, merged into Western Airlines in 1930) Defunct Delta subsidiaries Prior to 1981, the Delta corporate campus, an 80-acre (32&#160;ha) plot of land in proximity to the old Hartsfield Airport terminal, was outside the City of Atlanta limits in unincorporated Fulton County. On August 3, 1981 the Atlanta City Council approved the annexation of 141 acres (57&#160;ha) of land, an area containing the Delta headquarters. As of 1981 Delta would have had to begin paying $200,000 annually to the City of Atlanta in taxes. In September 1981 the airline sued the city, challenging the annexation on the basis of the constitutionality of the 1960 City of Atlanta annexation of the Hartsfield old terminal. Delta's current livery, ""Upward &amp; Onward"", uses four colors. It features a ""widget"" (delta) on each aircraft's vertical stabilizer to refer to Delta's origins as a carrier in the Mississippi Delta. These statistics about Delta's hubs are current as of (March 2016). (Ranked by daily departures). A Boeing 767-300ER at Beijing Capital Airport.

Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport – Delta, at one time, operated over 200 flights per day from DFW. At times, it was Delta's third-largest hub behind Atlanta and Cincinnati, respectively. Delta closed the hub in February 2005 due to competition with American Airlines, which had their largest hub at DFW. Frankfurt Airport – Upon Pan American World Airways' bankruptcy, Delta acquired its Frankfurt hub and the remainder of its Atlantic Division (including the JFK Worldport). Delta closed the hub in 1997. Memphis International Airport – A Delta hub that was originally dismantled but regained hub status through the merger with Northwest. The company's approximately 180 flight dispatchers are represented by the Professional Airline Flight Control Association (PAFCA). Not counting the pilots and flight dispatchers, Delta is the only one of the five largest airlines in the United States, and one of only two in the top 9 (the other being JetBlue), whose non-pilot staff is entirely non-union. Pilots at both airlines were unionized. Northwest Airlines flight attendants were formerly represented by the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA). The AFA accused Delta of interference in the vote and requested the National Mediation Board (NMB) investigate and order a second vote. Hawaiian Airlines (for flights within the state of Hawaii only) Inherited from the Northwest-KLM relationship (which is older than any of the three major airline alliances including SkyTeam itself), Delta has a transatlantic joint venture with Air France-KLM and Alitalia. The program coordinates transatlantic operations, including ticket pricing, schedules, capacity, and revenue. On December 11, 2012 Delta announced that it would spend $360 million to acquire a 49 percent stake in Virgin Atlantic. These shares were previously held by Singapore Airlines. As a part of this agreement, both airlines would share the costs and revenues from all of the joint venture flights the airlines operated. The two airlines planned to operate a total of 31 roundtrip flights between the UK and North America, including nine daily roundtrip flights between London Heathrow and New York City airports (John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport). Delta Air Lines has the largest Boeing 757 fleet of any airline Delta's Boeing 747 arrives at Ben Gurion Airport Boeing 777-200LR departs London Heathrow Airport, (2014) Main article: Delta Air Lines fleet As of January 2013 The carrier operates the largest fleets of Airbus A330 aircraft of any US airline. Delta also operates the largest fleets of Boeing 717, Boeing 757, Boeing 767, McDonnell Douglas MD-88, and McDonnell Douglas MD-90 aircraft in the world. Prior to its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines, Delta's fleet was made up of solely Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft; Airbus aircraft from Northwest joined the fleet after the merger. Unlike other mainline US legacy carriers, Delta has decided that its best path to profitability is a strategy that utilizes older aircraft, and Delta has created a very extensive MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) organization, called TechOps, to support them. The oldest aircraft in the fleet are the McDonnell Douglas MD-88s. Delta One cabin on a Boeing 747-400 (then known as ""BusinessElite"") The entertainment system and aisle view aboard a Boeing 777-200ER Delta One is the airline's long-haul international business class. The class was known as ""BusinessElite"" until March 1, 2015. Passengers in the Delta One cabin receive complimentary meals, refreshments, alcoholic beverages, and an amenity kit. Delta One is also available on domestic transcontinental service between New York and Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle. The flat-bed Delta One seats on Boeing 767-300ER and Boeing 767-400ER aircraft (made by Contour Aerospace and designed by James Thompson) feature a space-saving design, with the bottom ends of the seats extending under the armrests of the suites in front when in the horizontal position. The flat-bed Delta One seats on the Boeing 777-200ER/LRs feature sleeper suites made by Contour Aerospace and configured in a herringbone pattern with seats angled towards the aisle. The flat-bed seats on all Boeing 747-400 and Airbus A330s (as of October 2012) feature the Cirrus flat-bed sleeper suite made by Zodiac Seats U.S. (formerly Weber Aircraft LLC), designed by JPA Design Consultants, and configured in a reverse herringbone patterns with seats angled away from the aisles. Boeing 757-200 and aircraft configured with the Delta One cabin feature older recliner-style seating made by Recaro. Delta One seats on 767-300ERs have 60 inches (1,500&#160;mm) of pitch and 18.5 inches (470&#160;mm) of width, while seats on Boeing 757-200s have 55 inches (1,400&#160;mm) of pitch and 20 inches (510&#160;mm) of width. All seats are equipped with a personal, on demand In-Flight-Entertainment (IFE) system, universal power-ports, a movable reading light, and a folding work table. The Delta One seats ex-American Airlines/TWA 757-200s have electric recline, while those on ex-Northwest Airlines aircraft have mechanical recline. The ex-Northwest aircraft are planned to be converted back to a domestic configuration. On November 5, 2012, Delta announced it would introduce a flat-bed Delta One product on its ex-American Airlines/TWA 757-200s. First and Business Class (short and medium haul) First Class is offered on all domestic aircraft, as well as Delta Connection aircraft with more than 50 seats. Seats range from 18.5 to 20.75 inches (47.0 to 52.7&#160;cm) wide and have between 37 and 40 inches (94 and 102&#160;cm) of pitch. Passengers aboard this class receive free snacks, drinks, and alcohol, with full meal service on flights 900 miles and longer. Certain aircraft also feature power-ports at each seat. When a domestically configured aircraft operates on an international route, such as those to the Caribbean, the first class cabin is branded as Business Class. Delta Comfort+ Delta Comfort+ on a 757-200. Delta Comfort+ seats are installed on all Delta aircraft, as well as all two-cabin Delta Connection aircraft and feature 34–36 inches (860–910&#160;mm) of pitch; on all Delta One configured aircraft, 35–36 inches (890–910&#160;mm) of pitch and 50 percent more recline over standard Main Cabin seats. Main Cabin on a Boeing 767-400ER Main Cabin on a Boeing 737–800 Main Cabin (also known as ""Economy Class"") is available on all aircraft with seats ranging from 17 to 18 inches (43 to 46&#160;cm) wide and 30 to 33 inches (76 to 84&#160;cm) of pitch. The main cabin on Boeing 737, 747-400, 777, and selected Boeing 757-200, 767-300, and McDonnell Douglas MD-90 aircraft have an articulating seat bottom where the seat bottom moves forward in addition to the seat back tilting backwards when reclining. Main Cabin passengers receive complimentary snacks and non-alcoholic drinks domestically. Alcoholic beverages are also available for purchase. Complimentary meals and alcoholic drinks are provided on long-haul international flights. As part of Delta's EATS buy on board program, food is available for purchase on all domestic flights 1,500 miles (2,400&#160;km) or more (including Hawaii and Alaska flights, which no longer offer complimentary meal service). Prices ranged up to $10 ($12.53 when adjusted for inflation). The airline started the service on a few selected flights in July 2003, and the meal service was initially offered on 400 flights. Delta ended this buy on board program in 2005; instead, Delta began offering snacks at no extra charge on flights over 90 minutes to most U.S. domestic flights and some flights to the Caribbean and Latin America. Beginning in mid-March 2005 the airline planned to stop providing pillows on flights within the 49 contiguous U.S. states, Bermuda, Canada, the Caribbean, and Central America. In addition, the airline increased the price of alcoholic beverages on Delta mainline flights from $4 ($4.85 when adjusted for inflation) to $5 ($6.06 when adjusted for inflation); the increase in alcohol prices did not occur on Song flights. Audio Video on Demand offered domestically on select Delta aircraft Moving Map on a 757-200. In the 1960s audio programming was introduced where passengers wore headphones consisting of hollow tubes piping in music. These were installed in some Delta aircraft. Some early wide-bodied aircraft, including the Lockheed L-1011, Boeing 767-200, and 767-300 fleet, had movies projected on to the cabin bulkhead. Also during the late 1980s and early 1990s, CRT monitors over the aisles were added to the 757 fleet, making them the first narrowbody aircraft to feature video entertainment. The MD-90 introduced Delta's first IFE system with LCD monitors in 1995, and the 777 introduced Delta's first in-seat video system in 1999, initially using the Rockwell Collins Total Entertainment System. Delta's first all-digital IFE system with AVOD (Panasonic eFX) was first introduced in 2003 on Delta's former low-cost subsidiary, Song. The Rockwell Collins IFE system on the 777s was replaced by the Panasonic eFX system in 2007, followed by the Panasonic eX2 in 2011. The Panasonic eFX and eX2 systems are trademarked by Delta as Delta on Demand. The systems have been installed on the entire 747-400 fleet as of October 2012, and are currently being installed on the 767-300ER fleet (except for the six aircraft previously retrofitted with the eFX system in 2010). This was completed in late 2012. The 767-400ER fleet initially featured LCDs over the aisles, but were replaced in 2009 by the Panasonic eFX AVOD system when the last of the 767-400ERs were converted from domestic to international use. CRT projectors were originally featured in economy class on Boeing 767–300s, with the international 767-300ERs also featuring ceiling-mounted CRT displays over the aisles, which have since replaced by LCD monitors, and are now in the process of being converted to the eFX2 AVOD system. When Delta's ex-TWA ETOPS 757s were first delivered, they featured a system made by Sony Transcom (a former subsidiary of Sony now sold to Rockwell Collins) system that was factory installed for TWA. The system featured overhead drop-down LCD monitors similar to Delta's non-Transcon 737-800s and 757-300s. Delta replaced the Sony Transcom system with the Panasonic eFX system featuring in-seat video and AVOD at the same time as the new BusinessElite seats and slimline economy class seats were installed. Membership options include single visit passes and annual memberships that can be purchased with either money or miles. International business class passengers get free access. Membership can also be granted through top level Delta status or with the purchase of some American Express credit cards. Features vary by location, but generally include free drinks (including alcoholic beverages), snacks and reading material. Wi-Fi is free for members and guests and is mostly provided in the USA by AT&amp;T. Other benefits for Sky Club members include reciprocal lounge access with other SkyTeam members and Delta's other partners. In 2008, Delta Air Lines was given an award from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Design for the Environment (DfE) program for their use of PreKote, a more environmentally friendly, non-hexavalent chromium surface pretreatment on its aircraft, replacing hazardous chemicals formerly used to improve paint adhesion and prevent corrosion. In addition, PreKote reduces water usage by two-thirds and reduces wastewater treatment. PreKote is also saving money by reducing the time needed to paint each airplane. With time savings of eight to ten percent, it will save an estimated more than $1 million annually.

The same plane as above, re-christened in the memory of BCRF founder Evelyn Lauder, at JFK Airport in early 2015, with the pink ribbons on the engine nacelles. In September 2015, the same aircraft was repainted again in a hybrid livery, carrying BCRF titles on the nose with a pink ribbon across the fuselage.

Both the Delta (London-Cincinnati) and Continental (London-Newark) were heading to the U.S. with nearly 600 people total on both aircraft. The Delta flight strayed 60 miles (97&#160;km) off course to the south from its assigned ""C"" track during its flight and came within 30 feet (9.1&#160;m) of colliding with the 747 as the L-1011 flew under it in Canadian airspace, flying on the ""D"" track (there are five westbound and five eastbound tracks from the United States to the United Kingdom).

This coincided with the introduction of passenger screening using metal detectors in U.S. airports starting in the late 1960s. Additional hijackings which resulted in no injuries and the flight landing in Cuba include March 28, 1984 (Delta 357 New Orleans-Dallas 727), August 18, 1983 (Delta 784 Miami-Tampa 727), July 17, 1983 (Delta 722 Miami-Tampa 727), June 11, 1979 (Delta 1061 New York LaGuardia-Fort Lauderdale L1011) On February 22, 1974, Samuel Byck, an unemployed tire salesman from Pennsylvania, stormed aboard Delta Air Lines Flight 523, DC-9 flight at Baltimore Friendship Airport (now Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport) scheduled to fly to Atlanta and shot both pilots, killing the First Officer, Fred Jones.

It is a leader in consumable dental products. As an equipment maker it designs and manufactures laboratory and specialty products relating to dental supplies. With regards to consumable products it specializes in anesthetics, plaque and gum disease prevention (prophylaxis) and tooth polishers; It also designs and constructs artificial teeth. Because of the income disparity between wealthy and developing nations the variety of products in demand differs from region to region (and thus subsidiary to subsidiary since many of them are regional). In 2010 the most important markets for sales were Europe &amp; CIS (40%), USA (37%), Latin America (5%), Asia (excl CIS and Japan, 5%), Canada 4%, Japan (4%), Middle East &amp; Africa (3%) and Australia (2%). The largest market that Dentsply holds a leading market share in is the dental restorative sector ($4.0 billion according to the company). For 2012 acquisitions contributed all of the growth in sales (16.2%, currency effects were -3.8%). 2012 sales growth by region: Europe 27.5% (vs 17.9% in 2011), USA 13.8% (vs 4.9%), elsewhere 15.9% (vs 9.4%). 88% of net sales were in dental products, 12% from consumable medical device products (casting industry). On February 29, 2016 Dentsply combined with Long Island based Sirona Dental Systems in a $14.5 billion merger of equals. While both supply dental products, Sirona's business centers on dental equipment in contrast with Dentsply's consumables. Contents 1 History 2 Divisions 3 Products 4 References History Gendex's dental x-ray equipment business which complemented Dentsply's was founded in 1983. Dentsply was originally incorporated in 1899 as Dentists' Supply Company about the same time it made its first acquisition, a Pennsylvania porcelain teeth manufacturer. One of the 4 founders, George H. Whiteley became the main operator of the company as a result of his experience as a ceramicist. Whiteley's contributions to the company were invaluable as he was responsible for many innovations such as a patented process involving platinum rings that reduced tooth breakage. Other innovations (credited to doctors like James Williams who were hired by the company for research purposes) included better fitting dentures, tooth size for people of different face shapes and age specific colored teeth. In the early 1920s the company selected European distributor E.de Trey &amp; Sons as its primary marketer to Europe however it quickly became the company's main distributor in the US also. A rivalry between De Trey and the main other denture equipment producer at the time Ash company nearly eliminated cash flows due to extreme price cutting. The problem was resolved when the two decided to merge their distribution businesses into one named the Amalgamated Dental Company Limited. In 1925 45% of Zahnfabrik (artificial teeth producer) was bought by Dentists' Supply and its distributor Amalgamated Dental bought a 30% interest in the manufacturer. Key acquisitions by Dentists' Supply Company: LD Caulk Company in 1963, Ransom and Randolph Company in 1964, F&amp;F Koenigkramer Company (chairs and stools). Largest was Amalgamated Dental Industrial (former distributor that played a major role in helping the company grow early on that also controlled Australia's largest dental supply chain) in 1976. In 1993 after it acquired Gendex Corp in a reverse takeover it went public on the Nasdaq. The new company then purchased medical x-ray tubes supplier Eureka X-Ray Inc. which was key since Gendex was a major manufacturer of x-ray systems (Eureka X-Ray was later sold in 1994). In June 2011 Dentsply acquired Astra Tech, the world's third largest maker of dental implants from the Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for $1.8 billion. The deal raises revenue by 25% ($535M) and was completed on August 31, 2011. Acquisitions in 2011 caused the value of long term debt to increase by 147% while total assets grew by 146% (current assets however decreased in value). Many divisions are regional in terms of their base and the market they serve (Most in Asia are named after the country they serve) while others are focused on a specific product (e.g. Maillefer in endodontics). The divisions and subsidiaries sell their products through regionally focused distribution companies as well as dentists and dental schools.

Edwards, President &amp; CEO Products Offshore Drilling Revenue US$2.419 billion (2015) Operating income -US$294 million (2015) Net income -US$274 million (2015) Total assets US$7.165 billion (2015) Total equity US$4.113 billion (2015) Number of employees 3,400 (2015) Parent Loews Corporation (52%)  Diamond Offshore's beginnings can be traced back to the earliest days of the offshore drilling industry. Its predecessor companies were ODECO, Zapata Corporation, and Diamond M Drilling Co. Diamond Offshore’s roots date back to May 1953, when Alden J. (Doc) Laborde founded Ocean Drilling and Exploration Co. (ODECO) in New Orleans. Laborde had designed what was probably the first submersible drilling rig. After finding a financial backer in Charlie Murphy of Murphy Oil Co., a grateful Laborde built the rig in 1954 and named the unit Mr. Charlie in honor of his benefactor. Today, the Mr. Charlie is a museum and training facility in Morgan City, Louisiana. After noticing the stability of submersible rigs when they were only partially submerged for relocation, Laborde designed and constructed the first purpose-built semi-submersible rig, Ocean Driller, in 1964. ODECO rigs continued to rack up “firsts” in the industry in the 1970s, with Ocean Viking discovering the giant Ekofisk oil field for Phillips Petroleum Company in the North Sea and Ocean Victory discovering the Piper oilfield and Claymore field, also in the North Sea, for Occidental Petroleum. In the early 1960s the onshore drilling company Brewster-Bartle went bankrupt. The banks that had become the owners of the company’s rigs contacted Don McMahon to take over the failed company. McMahon accepted the challenge and formed Diamond M Drilling Co. in 1964. He named the company after Diamond M Acres, his ranch near Simonton, Texas. McMahon took his company public in 1970 and expanded into offshore waters with the building and purchase of jack-up, barge, and semi-submersible rigs. In the early 1970s, Diamond M was one of the largest owners of barge rigs in the energy industry. The company continued to drill both on land and offshore. In the late 1970s, Western Oceanic tendered an offer to buy Diamond M. Unwilling to be purchased, Diamond sought and found a “white knight” in Kaneb Services, Inc. In 1992, Diamond M Corporation purchased all of the outstanding stock of ODECO Drilling Inc. from ODECO Oil and Gas Co., a subsidiary of Murphy Oil. Shortly thereafter, Diamond M Corp. briefly changed its name to Diamond M-ODECO Drilling Inc. before becoming Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. in 1993. Diamond Offshore began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in October 1995 and acquired Arethusa (Offshore) Ltd. in April 1996.).push(function () { mw.loader.state({""ext.globalCssJs.site"":""ready"",""ext.globalCssJs.user"":""ready"",""user"":""ready"",""user.groups"":""ready""});mw.loader.load(); } );(window.RLQ = window.RLQ || ).push(function () { mw.config.set({""wgBackendResponseTime"":57,""wgHostname"":""mw1251""}); /* @nomin */ } "

Dollar_General," Dollar General Corporation Formerly called J.L. Turner and Son Wholesale Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;DG S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Discount retailer Founded 1939&#160;(1939) in Scottsville, Kentucky Founders J.L. Turner Cal Turner Sr. Headquarters 100 Mission Ridge, Goodlettsville, Tennessee, United States Number of locations 12,483&#160;(January 2016) Areas served Contiguous United States except for the Northwest and North Dakota. Key people Todd Vasos (Chairman &amp; CEO) David M. Tehle (Executive Vice President &amp; CFO) Products Clothing, cleaning supplies, home decor, health &amp; beauty aids, pet supplies, toys, seasonal items, and grocery Revenue $20.369 billion (2015) Operating income $1.940 billion (2015) Net income $1.165 billion (2015) Total assets $11.258 billion (2015) In recent years, the chain has started constructing more stand-alone stores, typically in areas not served by another general-merchandise retailer. In some cases, stores are within a few city blocks of each other. Dollar General offers both name brand and generic merchandise&#160;— including off-brand goods and closeouts of name-brand items&#160;— in the same store, often on the same shelf. Although it has the word ""dollar"" in the name, Dollar General is not a dollar store by the strict definition of that term as most of its products are priced at more than $1.00. However, goods are usually sold at set price points in the range of .50 to 60 dollars, excluding articles such as phone cards and loadable store gift cards. Dollar General often serves communities that are too small for Walmart stores (although many locations are in relatively close driving distance to a Walmart store or in the same communities that Walmart is located). It competes in the dollar store format with national chains Family Dollar and Dollar Tree, regional chains such as Fred's in the Southeast, and numerous independently owned stores. Since 2000, Dollar General has experimented with stores that carry a greater selection of grocery items. These stores, (similar to the Walmart Supercenter, but much smaller), operate under the name ""Dollar General Market"". Contents 1 History 1.1 Acquisition and spinoff 2 Dollar General Market 3 Motorsports connection 4 DG Brand 5 Expansion plans 6 Controversies 7 References 8 External links History In 1968, the business changed its name to Dollar General Corporation. In 2007, the company was acquired by the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), which took the company public in 2009. The first Dollar General store opened in Springfield, Kentucky, on June 1, 1955, the concept was that no item in the store would cost more than one dollar. The idea became a success, and other stores owned by J.L. Turner and his son Cal Turner were quickly converted. By 1957, annual sales of Dollar General's 29 stores were $5 million. The Turners did not reach this level of success without obstacles. James Luther (J.L.) Turner's father died in an accident in 1902 when J.L. was only 11. J.L. had to quit school so he could work the family farm and help provide for his mother and siblings. He never completed his education. J.L. knew his limited education demanded that he become a quick study of the world around him. After two unsuccessful attempts at retailing, J.L. became a traveling dry goods salesman for a Nashville wholesale grocer. J.L. left the sales job after 10 years and settled his family in Scottsville, Kentucky. During the Depression, he began buying and liquidating bankrupt general stores. J.L.'s only child, Cal Turner, Sr., accompanied his father to these closeouts at a young age, gaining valuable business knowledge and skills. In October 1939, J.L. and Cal opened J.L. Turner and Son Wholesale with an initial investment of $5,000 each. Wholesaling quickly gave way to retailing&#160;– J.L.'s third and final attempt at retailing. The switch to retailing resulted in annual sales above $2 million by the early 1950s. J.L. died in 1964. Four years later, the company he co-founded went public as Dollar General Corporation, posting annual sales of more than $40 million and net income in excess of $1.5 million. In 1977, Cal Turner, Jr., who joined the company in 1965 as the third generation Turner, succeeded his father as president of Dollar General. Cal Jr. led the company until his retirement in 2002. Under his leadership, the company grew to more than 6,000 stores and $6 billion in sales. Effective June 3, 2015, Chief Operating Officer Todd Vasos replaced Rick Dreiling as chief executive. Dreiling will remain senior advisor and chairman until his retirement in January 2016. On July 6, 2007, all shares of Dollar General stock were acquired by private equity investors for $22 per share. An investment group consisting of affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR), GS Capital Partners (an affiliate of Goldman Sachs), Citigroup Private Equity and other co-investors completed an acquisition of Dollar General Corporation for a total enterprise value of $7.3 billion. As a part of the transition to a privately held company, Dollar General assessed each location at the end of its lease against a model known as ""EZ Stores"". This assessment included evaluating whether the location had a loading dock, garbage dumpsters, adequate parking, and acceptable profitability. Stores that did not pass this evaluation were relocated or closed. Over 400 stores were closed as part of this initiative. Although the timing of the Initial Public Offering (IPO) was not announced by Dollar General or KKR, Dollar General filed on August 20, 2009 for an initial offering of up to $750 Million Dollar General Market Industry Grocery, variety store Founded 2009 Headquarters Goodlettsville, Tennessee, U.S. Products (Grocery: dairy, meat, produce, dry foods, frozen foods, snacks and beer). Other: clothing, cleaning supplies, home decor, health &amp; beauty aids, pet supplies, toys, tobacco products and seasonal items.

It is similar to a Walmart Supercenter, but smaller. Their store brands include Clover Valley, Smart &amp; Simple, DG Home, and Everpet.

Dominion also operates the nation's largest natural gas storage facility, amounting to more than 975&#160;billion cubic feet (2.76×1010&#160;m3) of storage capacity. The company's Cove Point liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal on the Chesapeake Bay is one of the nation's largest and busiest facilities of its kind. Dominion serves more than 5&#160;million retail energy customers in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions of the U.S. In 2009, Dominion was listed at #157 on the Fortune 500. In 1909, Dominion began operating as an investor-owned electric utility under the name Virginia Railway &amp; Power Company, founded by Frank Jay Gould, according to its website. In 1925, the name was changed to the Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO), and Dominion was operated as a regulated monopoly. In 1940, Dominion doubled its service territory by merging with the Virginia Public Service Company. In 1980, Dominion Resources, Inc., was incorporated as the holding company for VEPCO. In the 1980s, VEPCO was divided into three operating divisions, Virginia Power, North Carolina Power, and West Virginia Power. In 1986, Dominion gained territory by entering Northern Virginia after purchasing the Virginia distribution territory of Potomac Electric Power Company (PEPCO). In 1987, the West Virginia Power division was later sold to UtiliCorp United, but Dominion retained ownership of the Mount Storm Power Station in West Virginia. (In 1999, West Virginia Power would be sold to Allegheny Energy and folded into its Monongahela Power subsidiary; it and other Allegheny Energy subsidiaries have since been acquired in 2010 by FirstEnergy.)  The Dominion Political Action Committee (PAC) has been very active in donating to Virginia candidates. In 2009, the Dominion PAC donated a total of $814,885 with 56% going to Republicans and 41% to Democrats. In 2008, the PAC donated $539,038 with 50% going to Republicans and 47% to Democrats  This section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia's quality standards. No cleanup reason has been specified.

(March 2010) High voltage lines A number of controversies have surrounded the company's decisions to develop new routes for its electric power transmission lines. On February 13, 2007, The Washington Post reported that the power company was planning to change the route of one 500 kV transmission line to appease critics in Northern Virginia from a route that would cut through protected forest and farmland to a southern route that would bypass nature preserves and Civil War sites by running adjacent to existing power lines. However, U.S. Congressional Representative Frank Wolf (R - VA) and Governor Tim Kaine (D) remained opposed to the line, saying that there was no real need, and that Dominion was trying to bring cheap electricity from the Midwest. Dominion contested, saying that the line would bring needed electricity to growing Northern Virginia. The proposal was accepted by the State Corporation Commission (SCC) on October 7, 2008. On February 15, 2008, the SCC approved a controversial proposal for a 230 kV Dominion Virginia transmission line that would travel above ground for 1.8 miles (2.9&#160;km) along a wooded portion of the Washington &amp; Old Dominion Railroad Trail between Leesburg and Clarks Gap in Loudoun County, which Dominion again claimed was necessary for power reliability. Less than three weeks later, on March 4 and March 5, 2008, the Senate and the House of Delegates of the Virginia General Assembly unanimously passed emergency legislation that ordered the SCC to approve the underground construction of the line along that section of the trail as part of a four-part statewide pilot program for the development of underground transmission lines. Sponsored by Delegate Joe T. May (R - Loudoun), the legislation exempted the project from any requirements for further SCC analyses relating to the impacts of the route, including environmental impacts and impacts upon historical resources. The legislation went into effect when Virginia Governor Tim Kaine approved it on April 2, 2008. High levels of mercury emitted from the plant, which is controlled by activated carbon injection to reduce the emissions, as well as a fly ash dump near the Clinch River (a source of drinking water) are also of concern. The plant would also continue to support mountaintop removal coal mining. Supporters, including Governor Tim Kaine, stated that as one of the largest importers of electricity, Virginia could become less dependent on importing electricity from other states with a new power plant. In 2001 when Dominion's Dominion Cove Point LNG, LP subsidiary was scheduled to reopen, many local residents were concerned about the proximity (only 3 miles) to the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, and the damage that could be caused by an attack or an explosion at the plant. Residents thought that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission did not consider the risks before opening the plant. The Brayton Point Power Station in Somerset, Mass As of March 2010, the Political Economy Research Institute ranks Dominion Resources 51st among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. Dominion's Toxic Score of 16,656 (pounds released x toxicity x population exposure) represents a significant improvement from both the 2008 report (Dominion ranked 27th with a Toxic Score of 58,642) and the 2005 report (Dominion ranked 19th with a Toxic Score of 117,712)  In December 2007, a settlement between the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Dominion Energy of Brayton Point called for the company's power generating plant to install new closed cycle cooling towers that provided significant protection to aquatic organisms in Mount Hope Bay, which flows into Narragansett Bay. The 2007 settlement resolved an ongoing dispute that began in 2003. The EPA issued a final discharge permit called a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) for the Brayton Point Power Station requiring significant reductions in thermal discharges to, and water intake from, Mount Hope Bay. ^ a b c d e f g h i ""DOMINION RESOURCES INC /VA/ 2013 Annual Report Form (10-K)"" (XBRL).

Lee Cook Company (seals and piston rings), Rotary Lift (automotive lifts), C. Norris (oil-well pump-sucker rods), and Peerless (space heaters). 1964 marked a significant year, as OPW's former leader Thomas Sutton became president of Dover and corporate headquarters were relocated to New York City. The 1970s were characterized by Dover's intent to expand beyond its principle industries of building materials, equipment, and industrial components. A result of this effort included the acquisition of Dieterich Standard, which manufactured liquid-measurement instruments and whose president, Gary Roubos, went on to become Dover's chief operating officer (COO) and president in 1977. Later, Roubos became Dover's chief executive officer (CEO) in 1981. Today, Knowles continues to be a global supplier of communication-technology components, such as MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical systems), microphones, speakers, receivers, transducers, capacitors and oscillators. Dover's organization and segment structure has changed over its history. For example, in 1985 Dover restructured into five major subsidiaries to reflect its key markets of interest. For reporting purposes, these five major subsidies were represented in four sections: building industries (Dover Elevator International); electronic products (Dover Technologies); petroleum (Dover Resources); and industrial and aerospace products (Dover Industries, Dover Sargent). In 1989, Dover re-segmented into six sectors based on market activity changes: Dover Elevator International, Dover Technology, Dover Resources, Dover Industries, Dover Diversified, and Corporate Companies. After selling Dover Elevator, these segments became Diversified, Electronics, Industries, Resources, Systems and Technologies. Today, the Energy segment works in the drilling and production markets to develop solutions that advance the efficiency and safety of extracting oil and gas. It is composed of seven operating companies: Cook Compression, Dover Artificial Lift, Dover Energy Automation (DEA), Accelerated Process Systems, TWG, US Synthetic, and Waukesha Bearings. The Fluids segment designs and manufactures products and systems that safely handle critical fluids for the following end markets: oil-and-gas, retail-fueling, vehicle-wash, chemical, hygienic (food and pharmaceutical), and industrial. This segment is composed of: Colder Products Company, Finder, Hydro Systems Company, Maag, OPW, and Pump Solutions Group."

Credit reporting program This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (March 2015) In August 2006, DTE Energy began reporting payment information to the major credit bureaus on all of its 2.5 million customers without offering the ability to opt out, making it one of the few utilities in the US to do so. Previously, only seriously delinquent accounts were reported. Groups, such as the NAACP, protested this change, on the basis that such a policy would benefit those who have no problems paying their bills, but would hurt those who are the most vulnerable economically and most likely to miss a payment, such as the poor, elderly, and disabled. This, in effect, would hurt their credit rating, and further hamper their ability to advance in society. In January 2007, DTE Energy changed the policy to state that only payments 60 days or more overdue would be reported to the credit bureaus. Home Protection Plus (HPP) Through its Michcon department, DTE Energy offers customers seven different appliance protection plans covering parts (with some exclusions) and labour on major household appliances such as furnaces, boilers, water heaters, central air conditioner systems, laundry and kitchen equipment in exchange for a monthly fee. The Whole Home Protection Plan, added in 2013, also covers plumbing inside the home as well. These are advertised on a separate website. DTE Energy also uses outsourced call centres who solicit these plans by telephone directly to its customers, offering a negative option billing approach, whereby customers are offered the plans with a fifteen day review period before the plans come into effect, as well as an incentive to enroll on the phone. The plans are also advertised through separate mailings and inserts with bills. The HPP service is not regulated by the Michigan Public Service Commission. Criticism"

I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, commonly referred to as DuPont, is an American conglomerate that was founded in July 1802 as a gunpowder mill by Éleuthère Irénée du Pont. In the 20th century, DuPont developed many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, and later more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair. In 2014, DuPont was the world's fourth largest chemical company based on market capitalization Its stock price is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered divestment. The court ruling resulted in the creation of the Hercules Powder Company (later Hercules Inc. and now part of Ashland Inc.) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now part of AkzoNobel). At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single base nitrocellulose powders, while Hercules held the double base powders combining nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. DuPont subsequently developed the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of smokeless powders. In 1914, Pierre S. du Pont invested in the fledgling automobile industry, buying stock in General Motors (GM). The following year he was invited to sit on GM's board of directors and would eventually be appointed the company's chairman. The DuPont company would assist the struggling automobile company further with a $25 million purchase of GM stock. In 1920, Pierre S. du Pont was elected president of General Motors. Under du Pont's guidance, GM became the number one automobile company in the world. However, in 1957, because of DuPont's influence within GM, further action under the Clayton Antitrust Act forced DuPont to divest its shares of General Motors. Major breakthroughs: 1920s–1930s Plenish is genetically engineered to ""block the formation of enzymes that continue the cascade downstream from oleic acid (that produces saturated fats), resulting in an accumulation of the desirable monounsaturated acid."" In 2004, the company sold its textiles business, which included some of its best-known brands such as Lycra (Spandex), Dacron polyester, Orlon acrylic, Antron nylon and Thermolite, to Koch Industries. In 2011, DuPont was the largest producer of titanium dioxide in the world, primarily provided as a white pigment used in the paper industry. Major manufacturing sites include the Spruance plant near Richmond, Virginia, (currently the company's largest plant), the Washington Works site in Washington, West Virginia, the Mobile Manufacturing Center (MMC) in Axis, Alabama, the Bayport plant near Houston, Texas, the Mechelen site in Belgium, and the Changshu site in China.

The facility will be state-owned and operated by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC). One of DuPont's facilities was listed No. 4 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010, legally discharging over 5,000,000 pounds (2,300,000&#160;kg) of toxic chemicals into New Jersey/Delaware waterways. Four employees died of suffocation in a Houston, Texas accident involving leakage of nearly 24,000 pounds (11,000&#160;kg) of methyl mercaptan. DuPont, along with Thomas Midgley working under Charles Kettering of General Motors, was the inventor of CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons). Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; C8) DuPont has faced fines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and litigation over releases of the Teflon-processing aid perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA, also known as C8) from their works in Washington, West Virginia. Jeff Gordon's car with the DuPont Cromax Pro sponsorship DuPont is widely known for its sponsorship of former four-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon and his Hendrick Motorsports No. 24 Chevrolet SS. DuPont sponsored him since he began in Sprint Cup (then Winston Cup) in 1992. DuPont said this about their sponsorship: Our sponsorship of Jeff Gordon helps keep DuPont brands and products in the public eye. Branding is a key component of the DuPont knowledge intensity strategy for achieving sustainable growth. In addition to Gordon, DuPont sponsored Scott Lagasse in the SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman during the 1995 season (including a one-off ride for Terry Labonte in the Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic, the inaugural Truck race)."

Duke Energy's service territory covers 104,000 square miles (270,000&#160;km2) with 250,200 miles (402,700&#160;km) of distribution lines. Almost all of Duke Energy's Midwest generation comes from coal, natural gas, or oil, while half of its Carolinas generation comes from its nuclear power plants. During 2006, Duke Energy generated 148,798,332 megawatt-hours of electrical energy. Duke Energy Renewable Services (DERS), a subsidiary of Duke Energy, specializes in the development, ownership, and operation of various generation facilities throughout the United States. This segment of the company operates 1,700 megawatts of generation. 240 megawatts of wind generation were under construction and 1,500 additional megawatts of wind generation were in planning stages.

With the purchase of Cinergy Corporation announced in 2005 and completed on April 3, 2006, Duke Energy Corporation's customer base grew to include the Midwestern United States as well. The company operates nuclear power plants, coal-fired plants, conventional hydroelectric plants, natural-gas turbines to handle peak demand, and pumped hydro storage. During 2006, Duke Energy also acquired Chatham, Ontario-based Union Gas, which is regulated under the Ontario Energy Board Act (1998). On January 3, 2007, Duke Energy spun off its gas business to form Spectra Energy. Duke Energy shareholders received 1 share of Spectra Energy for each 2 shares of Duke Energy. After the spin-off, Duke Energy now receives the majority of its revenue from its electric operations in portions of North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. The spinoff to Spectra also included Union Gas, which Duke Energy acquired the previous year. Main article: William States Lee III Nuclear Generating Station On March 16, 2006, Duke Power announced that a Cherokee County, SC site had been selected for a potential new nuclear power plant. The site is jointly owned by Duke Power and Southern Company. Duke plans to develop the site for two Westinghouse Electric Company AP1000 (advanced passive) pressurized water reactors. Each reactor is capable of producing approximately 1,117 megawatts. (See Nuclear Power 2010 Program.) On December 14, 2007, Duke Power submitted a Combined Construction and Operating License to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with an announcement that it will spend $160 million in 2008 on the plant with a total cost of 5–6 billion dollars. In 1999 the United States Environmental Protection Agency commenced an enforcement action against Duke Energy for making modifications to very old and deteriorating coal-burning power plants without getting permits under the Clean Air Act. Duke asserted that a ""modification"" under the Clean Air Act did not require a permit. Environmental groups asserted that Duke was using loopholes in the law to increase emissions. Initially, Duke prevailed at the trial court level, but in 2006 the case was argued before the Supreme Court (Environmental Defense v. Duke Energy Corp. (05-848)). The Court unanimously ruled on April 2, 2007 that the modifications allowed the power plants to operate for more hours, increasing emissions, so Clean Air Act permits were needed. The Political Economy Research Institute ranks Duke Energy 13th among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (80 million pounds in 2005) and toxicity of the emissions. This change reflects the purchase of fossil fuel-heavy Cinergy, which occurred in 2005.

(June 2008) In early 2008, Duke Energy announced a plan to build the new, 800-megawatt Cliffside Unit 6 coal plant 55 miles (89&#160;km) west of Charlotte, North Carolina. The plan has been strongly opposed by environmental groups such as Rising Tide North America, Rainforest Action Network, the community-based Canary Coalition as well as the Southern Environmental Law Center, which has threatened to sue Duke if it does not halt construction plans. On April 1, activists locked themselves to machinery at the Cliffside construction area as part of Fossil Fools Day. Duke Energy has been ""one of the most vocal advocates"" In a joint venture with the French-based global energy firm AREVA, under the nominal name of ADAGE, Duke Energy has planned a ""Green"" biomass burning facility in Mason County, Washington and is negotiating with forestland owners to secure the 600,000 tons of wood debris it needs yearly to fuel its $250 million biomass plant. The joint venture between electric power company Duke Energy and global nuclear services giant AREVA was created to build wood waste-to-energy power plants around the country. ADAGE president Reed Wills announced the first Northwest outpost will be in the struggling timber town of Shelton, Washington. The following pollutants are provided by DUKE-AREVA-ADAGE in their application for permit to the Department of Environmental Protection for a similar type of plant in Florida. 247 tons per year – particulate matter 239 tons per year – particulate matter 10 233 tons per year – particulate matter 2.5 249 tons per year – NOx (nitrogen oxides) 246 tons per year – SO2 (sulfur dioxide) 248 tons per year – CO (carbon monoxide) 40 tons per year – H2SO4 – (sulfuric acid mist) 63 tons per year – VOC (volatile organic compounds) 29 tons per year – F (fluorides) This list is partially complete due to the July 3, 2012, merger with Progress Energy.

(October 2013) An effect of World War I was a scarcity in raw materials such as photographic paper, optical glass, gelatin and many chemicals, including methanol, acetic acid and acetone. After the war ended, Eastman Kodak founder George Eastman began working to have an independent supply of chemicals for his photographic processes. His search for suitable quantities of methanol and acetone led him to the southern United States. In 1920, Tennessee Eastman was founded with two major platforms – organic chemicals and acetyls. Products such as calcium acetate, sodium acetate, acetic acid, and acetic anhydride became the basis for the company’s platforms. During World War II, RDX, a powerful explosive, was manufactured for the U.S. government at Holston Ordnance Works at Tennessee Eastman sites. At the peak of production near the end of the war, the ordnance plant was producing a million and a half pounds of explosives each day. Tennessee Eastman was responsible for managing the Y-12 National Security Complex at Oak Ridge, Tennessee which produced enriched uranium for the Manhattan Project, from 1943 to May 1947. The company transferred scientists from Kingsport, Tennessee via an underground railroad operated by a heroic conductor trained by the United States Army. Eastman introduced acetate tow to the industry in 1952 and remains a leading global manufacturer, selling under the trademark name Estron. Estron is used to produce items such as cigarette filters and ink reservoirs for fiber-tip pens. The most significant product line developed for use with cellulose acetate tow is Estrobond plasticizers, used to impart rigidity and hardness to acetate fiber rods. By the late 1960s, Tennessee Eastman was manufacturing products that were used in clothing, home furnishings, the automobile industry and other areas. Additional manufacturing facilities were constructed in strategic locations. During the 1970s Eastman began producing PET plastics, a light-weight, recyclable packaging material, widely used in packaging, including bottles for water, carbonated beverages, and cosmetics. Since the 1980s Eastman is a member of Responsible Care, a global voluntary initiative developed autonomously by the chemical industry to improve health, safety, and environmental performance. In January 2008, Corporate Responsibility Officer Magazine (CRO) named Eastman one of the five best corporate citizens among chemical companies in the U.S. Eastman was awarded the 2009 Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award presented by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The award recognizes technologies that incorporate the principles of green chemistry into chemical design, manufacture, and use.

Today, Eaton Electrical manufactures electrical distribution and control products branded ""Eaton"" or ""Cutler-Hammer"" which can replace Westinghouse products in commercial and industrial applications. Eaton spun off its semiconductor manufacturing equipment business as Axcelis Technologies in 2000. In 2003, Eaton's Electrical Distribution and Control business (formerly known as Cutler-Hammer) acquired the electrical division of Delta plc. This acquisition brought Delta's brands Holec, MEM, Tabula, Bill and Elek under the Eaton nameplate with the previous Westinghouse divisions and gave the company manufacturing facilities to meet IEC standards, one of the steps to become a global company and developing a worldwide standard. Soon after this acquisition, Eaton entered a joint venture with Caterpillar Inc. and purchased 51% of I &amp; S operations (now known as Intelligent Switchgear Organization, LLC). The Powerware brand is known for the design and production of medium to large Uninterruptible Power System (UPS) devices. After several years of co-branding UPS products ""Eaton|Powerware"" the company is switching to the single brand Eaton for all UPS products including; BladeUPS, 9355, 9390, 9395, and 9E. In 2006, Eaton entered the data center power distribution market. Initial products were internally developed PDU's and RPP's under the Powerware brand and included the PowerXpert metering system. A Powerware brand Static Transfer Switch was added to the portfolio through a brand-label relationship with Cyberex. To complete the power distribution portfolio Eaton released a line of rack power distribution products under its Powerware brand called ePDU. It acquired Aphel Technologies Ltd., a manufacturer of power distribution product for data centers based in Coventry, UK. Eaton Corporation plc completed its acquisition of Cooper Industries on Nov 30, 2012. The $13 billion acquisition of Cooper (USD$5.4B Sales revenue -2011), became the largest in Eaton's (USD$16B Sales Revenue-2011) 101-year history. In 2013, Eaton has been ranked a global leader by Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and was named to the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index. Eaton’s position in the index ranked it first among its global competitors in the industrials sector."

(stylized as ""ebay"" since late 2012) is an American multinational corporation and e-commerce company, providing consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales services via the internet. It is headquartered in San Jose, California. eBay was founded by Pierre Omidyar in 1995, and became a notable success story of the dot-com bubble. Today it is a multibillion-dollar business with operations localized in over 30 countries. The company manages eBay.com, an online auction and shopping website in which people and businesses buy and sell a broad variety of goods and services worldwide. In addition to its auction-style sales, the website has since expanded to include ""Buy It Now"" shopping; shopping by UPC, ISBN, or other kind of SKU (via Half.com); online classified advertisements (via Kijiji or eBay Classifieds); online event ticket trading (via StubHub); and other services. It previously offered online money transfers (via PayPal), The AuctionWeb was founded in California on September 3, 1995 by French-born Iranian-American computer programmer Pierre Omidyar (born June 21, 1967) as part of a larger personal site. This was revealed in Adam Cohen's book, The Perfect Store (2002), Reportedly, eBay was simply a side hobby for Omidyar until his Internet service provider informed him he would need to upgrade to a business account due to the high volume of traffic to his website. The resulting price increase (from $30/month to $250) forced him to start charging those who used eBay, and was not met with any animosity. Fixed-price listings have an insertion fee of $0.30, and the final value fee varies based on category and total amount of the sale (e.g., 13% for DVDs &amp; Movies up to $50). However Value Added Tax (VAT), the EU countries' sales tax, is different. eBay requires sellers to include the VAT element in their listing price and not as an add-on and thus profits by collecting fees based not only on the sale price ""ex VAT"" but also on the VAT. The building, the first the company had built in its 13-year existence, uses an array of 3,248 solar panels, spanning 60,000 square feet (5,600&#160;m2), and providing 650 kilowatts of power to eBay's campus. SolarCity, the company responsible for designing the array, estimates that the solar panels installed on eBay's campus will prevent 37 million pounds of carbon dioxide from being released into the environment as a result of replaced power production over the next three decades. Creating an equivalent impact to remove the same amount of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere would require planting 322 acres (1.30&#160;km2) of trees. Eight months after the acquisition, StubHub reached an exclusive agreement with Major League Baseball (MLB). around the world now use eBay as well as traditional auctions to dispose of seized and confiscated goods Controversy has arisen over certain items put up for bid. For instance, in late 1999, a man offered one of his kidneys for auction on eBay, attempting to profit from the potentially lucrative (and, in the United States, illegal) market for transplantable human organs. In general, the company removes auctions that violate its Terms of Service agreement. eBay North First Street satellite office campus (home to PayPal) Beginning in August 2007, eBay required listings in ""Video Games"" and ""Health &amp; Beauty"" to accept its payment system PayPal and sellers could only accept PayPal for payments in the category ""Video Games: Consoles"". was also opened in 2006 and closed in 2008. At the 2008 eBay Developer's Conference, eBay announced the Selling Manager Applications program (SM Apps). In its earliest days, eBay was nearly unregulated. However, as the site grew, it became necessary to restrict or forbid auctions for various items. Note that some of the restrictions relate to eBay.com (the U.S. site), while other restrictions apply to specific European sites (such as Nazi paraphernalia). Regional laws and regulations may apply to the seller or the buyer. Generally, if the sale or ownership of an item is regulated or prohibited by one or more states, eBay will not permit its listing. Among the hundred or so banned or restricted categories: Tobacco (tobacco-related items and collectibles are accepted.) Alcohol (alcohol-related collectibles, including sealed containers, as well as some wine sales by licensed sellers are allowed, some sites such as ebay.com.au allow licensed liquor sales) (eBay announced September 21, 2012, it will begin removing listings for beer and liquor from its site after a story was aired on ABC series 20/20.) Items that ""promote or glorify hatred, violence, racial, sexual, or religious intolerance, or promote organizations with such views."" This includes Nazi paraphernalia although there are exceptions to this rule for nazi items such as Stamps, letters, and envelopes displaying Nazi postmarks (must comply with the currency and stamp policy) Currency issued by the Nazi German government, including military scripts Historically accurate WWII military model kits that have Nazi symbols  Firearms and ammunition (as of January 1, 1999), including any parts that could be used to assemble a firearm as well as (as of July 30, 2007) any firearm part that is required for the firing of a gun, including bullet slugs, brass casings and shells, slides, cylinders, magazines, firing pins, trigger assemblies, etc. Various types of knives are also forbidden. Police and emergency service vehicular warning equipment such as red or blue lights and sirens (antique or collectible items are exempt) Intentionally soiled underwear (see Panty fetishism) and dirty used clothing Human body parts, organs, and remains (with an exception for skeletons and skulls for scientific study, provided they are not Native American in origin) Live animals (with certain exceptions) Knives, other than some cutlery, are prohibited in the UK following the criminal importation into the UK (by BBC Watchdog researchers) of several knives that were already illegal to own or import under existing UK legislation. The ban also includes empty leather knife scabbards if they are listed under the category of ""knives"" on one of the eBay sites Bidding on eBay (old or new)'s auction-style listing is called proxy bidding and is essentially equivalent to a Vickrey auction (sealed-bid), with the following exceptions. The winning bidder pays the second-highest bid plus one bid increment amount (that is, some small predefined amount relative to the bid size), instead of simply the highest bid. However, since the bid increment amounts are relatively insignificant compared to the bid size, they are not considered from a strategic standpoint. The highest bidder's bid is sealed, as in a Vickrey auction, but the current winning bid (second highest plus one increment) is displayed throughout the auction to allow price discovery. Because eBay's auction-style listings are sealed-bid, it is usually to all bidders' advantage that bids are made only at the very end of the auction. Early bids will not always increase the bidder's chance of winning the auction, and will often raise the item's final price (winning bid) for the winner. eBay also allows the sellers to offer a ""Buy it Now"" price that will end the auction immediately. The Buy It Now price is available until someone bids on the item, or until the reserve price is met. When the Buy It Now option disappears, the auction-style listing proceeds normally. sent to Mark P. Mays, CEO of Clear Channel (parent company of Premiere Radio Networks the production company that produces The Rush Limbaugh Show and Glenn Beck Program) by Senator Harry Reid and forty other Democratic senators, complaining about comments made by conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh. The winning bid was $2,100,100, with all of the proceeds going to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation, benefiting the education of children of men and women who have died serving in the armed forces. The winning bid was matched by Limbaugh in his largest charity donation to date."

Edison first became a holding company in 1988 when it made a small change to its original name, becoming known as SCEcorp. In 2001 Edison's main holding, Southern California Edison faced bankruptcy after a state senate bill regarding financial assistance came up short (by $1 billion). In November 2010 Edison sold its 48% interest in the Four Corners coal-fired power plant in New Mexico (units 4 and 5 while units 1,2 and 3 will be closed because of being older) for $294 million to Pinnacle West Capital Corp (of Arizona Public Service). The move was the direct result of a new California law requiring utility companies to exit coal-fired power production (even the renewing of contracts is disallowed), and forces Edison to purchase more power from the market. At least 34% of the fuel Southern California Edison uses to generate power comes from clean energy (half of that nuclear power, the other half renewable energy sources ranging from biomass to wind).).push(function(){mw.loader.state({""ext.globalCssJs.site"":""ready"",""ext.globalCssJs.user"":""ready"",""user"":""ready"",""user.groups"":""ready""});mw.loader.load();});(window.RLQ=window.RLQ||).push(function(){mw.config.set({""wgBackendResponseTime"":66,""wgHostname"":""mw1248""});}"

It is mostly known for a transcatheter aortic heart valve made of bovine tissue within a collapsible stainless-steel stent, deployed via catheter. The Edwards SAPIEN family of heart valves are delivered via a procedure called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This procedure enables the placement of a collapsible heart valve into the body via a tube-based delivery system (catheter) that can be inserted through multiple access routes, including either an incision in the leg (transfemoral), or in between the ribs and to be threaded up to the heart (transapical), or through the front of the chest and then through a small hole in the aorta (transaortic). The valve is designed to replace a patient’s diseased native aortic valve without traditional open-heart surgery and while the heart continues to beat – avoiding the need to stop the patient’s heart and connect them to a heart-lung machine that temporarily takes over the function of the heart and the patient’s breathing during surgery (cardiopulmonary bypass). Edwards also manufactures products for vascular therapy along with hemodynamic monitoring devices for measuring cardiovascular performance during surgery and in the ICU. Hemodynamic monitoring is the measurement of blood circulation and cardiac function that allows clinicians to evaluate whether enough oxygen is being delivered to the organs and tissues. Among these is the Swan-Ganz catheter. Originally developed for patients with acute myocardial infarction, it is now used in anesthesia and critical care units. Healthcare providers use this monitoring to detect changes or problems in a patient’s health, which allows for more informed, immediate treatment decisions. To facilitate on-pump cardiac surgery procedures through smaller incisions, Edwards also offers a cardiac surgery product line comprising soft tissue retractors, venous and arterial cannulae, aortic occlusion, venting, and coronary sinus catheters, as well as reusable instruments for performing minimally invasive valvular procedures.).push(function(){mw.loader.state({""ext.globalCssJs.site"":""ready"",""ext.globalCssJs.user"":""ready"",""user"":""ready"",""user.groups"":""ready""});mw.loader.load();});(window.RLQ=window.RLQ||).push(function(){mw.config.set({""wgBackendResponseTime"":75,""wgHostname"":""mw1083""});}"

(EA), also known as EA Games, is an American developer, marketer, publisher and distributor of video games headquartered in Redwood City, California. Founded and incorporated on May 28, 1982, by Trip Hawkins, the company was a pioneer of the early home computer games industry and was notable for promoting the designers and programmers responsible for its games. As of 2014, Electronic Arts was the world's fourth-largest gaming company by revenue after Tencent, Sony and Microsoft. EA continued its shift toward digital goods in 2012, folding its mobile-focused EA Interactive (EAi) division ""into other organizations throughout the company, specifically those divisions led by EA Labels president Frank Gibeau, COO Peter Moore, and CTO Rajat Taneja, and EVP of digital Kristian Segerstrale."" to discuss financing his new venture, Amazin' Software. Valentine encouraged Hawkins to leave Apple Inc., in which Hawkins served as Director of Product Marketing, and allowed Hawkins use of Sequoia Capital's spare office space to start the company. On May 28, 1982, Trip Hawkins incorporated and established the company with a personal investment of an estimated US$200,000. Seven months later in December 1982, Hawkins secured US$2&#160;million of venture capital from Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, and Sevin Rosen Funds. Electronic Arts' original corporate logo, 1982–2000. For more than seven months, Hawkins refined his Electronic Arts business plan. With aid from his first employee (with whom he worked in marketing at Apple), Rich Melmon, the original plan was written, mostly by Hawkins, on an Apple II in Sequoia Capital's office in August 1982. During that time, Hawkins also employed two of his former staff from Apple, Dave Evans and Pat Marriott, as producers, and a Stanford MBA classmate, Jeff Burton from Atari for international business development. The business plan was again refined in September and reissued on October 8, 1982. Between September and November, employee headcount rose to 11, including Tim Mott, Bing Gordon, David Maynard, and Steve Hayes. While at Apple, Hawkins had enjoyed company offsite meetings at Pajaro Dunes and organized such a planning offsite for EA in October 1982. Hawkins had developed the ideas of treating software as an art form and calling the developers, ""software artists"". Hence, the latest version of the business plan had suggested the name ""SoftArt"". However, Hawkins and Melmon knew the founders of Software Arts, the creators of VisiCalc, and thought their permission should be obtained. Dan Bricklin did not want the name used because it sounded too similar (perhaps ""confusingly similar"") to Software Arts. However, the name concept was liked by all the attendees. Hawkins had also recently read a best-selling book about the film studio, United Artists, and liked the reputation that the company had created. Early advisers Andy Berlin, Jeff Goodby, and Rich Silverstein (who would soon form their own ad agency Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners) were also fans of that approach, and the discussion was led by Hawkins and Berlin. Hawkins said everyone had a vote but they would lose it if they went to sleep. The square ""album cover"" boxes (such as the covers for 1983's M.U.L.E. and Pinball Construction Set) were a popular packaging concept by Electronic Arts, which wanted to represent their developers as ""rock stars"". In the mid-1980s Electronic Arts aggressively marketed products for the Commodore Amiga, a premier home computer of the late 1980s and early 1990s in Europe. Commodore had given EA development tools and prototype machines before Amiga's actual launch. For Amiga EA published some notable non-game titles. A drawing program Deluxe Paint (1985) and its subsequent versions became perhaps the most famous piece of software available for Amiga platform. Other Amiga programs released by EA included Deluxe Music Construction Set, Deluxe Paint Animation and Instant Music. Some of them, most notably Deluxe Paint, were ported also for other platforms. For Macintosh platform EA released a black &amp; white animation tool called Studio/1, and a series of Paint titles called Studio/8 and Studio/32 (1990). In 1988 EA published a flight simulator game exclusively for Amiga, F/A-18 Interceptor, which received attention due to its vector graphics that were notable for 1988 standards. Another significant Amiga release (also initially available for Atari ST, later converted for numerous other platforms) was Populous (1989) developed by Bullfrog Productions. It was a hugely influential pioneering title in the genre that is called ""god games"". In 1990, Electronic Arts began producing console games for the Nintendo Entertainment System, after previously licensing its computer games to other console-game publishers. Headquarters of EA in October 2007. This section requires expansion. (June 2012) EA is currently The ESPN deal gave EA exclusive first rights to all ESPN content for sports simulation games. On April 11, 2005, EA announced a similar, 6-year licensing deal with the Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC) for exclusive rights to college football content. In September 2006, Nokia and EA announced a partnership in which EA becomes an exclusive major supplier of mobile games to Nokia mobile devices through the Nokia Content Discoverer. In the beginning, Nokia customers were able to download seven EA titles (Tetris, Tetris Mania, The Sims 2, Doom, FIFA 06, Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 and FIFA Street 2) on the holiday season in 2006. Rick Simonson is the executive vice president and director of Nokia and starting from 2006 is affiliated with John Riccitiello and are partners. Riccitiello previously worked for Elevation Partners, Sara Lee and PepsiCo. In June 2007, new CEO John Riccitiello announced that EA would reorganize itself into four labels, each with responsibility for its own product development and publishing (the city-state model). The goal of the reorganization was to empower the labels to operate more autonomously, streamline decision-making, increase creativity and quality, and get games into the market faster. resulting in the shutdown of popular communities such as Battlefield News at the Wayback Machine (archived January 12, 2006) and the EA Community Team at the Wayback Machine (archived February 5, 2009).

It is headquartered in the Central Business District of New Orleans, Louisiana. Meanwhile, in 1922, Sidney Mitchel of Electric Bond and Share Company (EBASCO), a subsidiary of General Electric, had merged several competing electric utilities in New Orleans into New Orleans Public Service, an EBASCO subsidiary. Mitchel began turning his attention to other territories, and eventually began competing with Couch. The two men ultimately decided to merge their resources. In 1925, Electric Power and Light Corporation, an EBASCO subsidiary headquartered in New Orleans, was formed with Couch as its president. It was the parent company for Mississippi Power and Light, Louisiana Power and Light, New Orleans Public Service and Arkansas Power and Light. Entergy Arkansas (formerly Arkansas Power and Light Company (AP&amp;L)) Entergy Gulf States Louisiana (formerly Gulf States Utilities (GSU)) Entergy Louisiana (formerly Louisiana Power and Light Company (LP&amp;L)) Entergy New Orleans (formerly New Orleans Public Service, Inc. (NOPSI)) Entergy Nuclear Entergy Mississippi (formerly Mississippi Power and Light Company (MP&amp;L)) Entergy Texas (formerly Gulf States Utilities (GSU)) Former Subsidiary Company Logos Entergy's main operating segments consist of the U.S. utility segment and the non-utility nuclear segment. The U.S. utility segment provides retail electricity services to approximately 2.7 million customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The non-utility nuclear segment operates a total of ten nuclear power plants: New York – Indian Point Energy Center and FitzPatrick (Fitzpatrick station scheduled for closing in 2016 or 2017) Massachusetts – Pilgrim (scheduled for closing in 2019) Vermont – Vermont Yankee (scheduled for decommission beginning in 2015) Its extensive transmission system carries approximately 23,000 megawatts of power across more than 15,500 miles (24,900&#160;km) of interconnected lines within a 112,000-square-mile (290,000&#160;km2) area. Entergy is the only U.S. utility to make the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) nine years in a row. The DJSI is a listing of the companies whose overall environmental, social and economic sustainability performance scores were in the top 10 percent for their sector. to have its license renewed for another 20 years. The vote will not affect current operation of the plant, and the issue could be revisited by the legislature in either a special session later in 2010 or in its next regular session in 2011. Entergy-Texas operates as a wholly owned subsidiary. This was done to prepare the Texas side for de-regulation under Texas law but later Entergy notified the Texas PUC it would not be splitting the Texas side off as a de-regulated operation (to do so would cost billions). So the Texas side has remained connected to the rest of the Entergy network, though it has its own CEO and until 2012, was based where the former Gulf States Utilities was, in Beaumont, Texas. Entergy-Texas has moved to the rapidly developing area of The Woodlands, which is now larger population wise than the Beaumont area. Paul Hinnenkamp was named Chief Operating Officer and senior vice president in November 2015. He replaced Mark Savoff, who announced his retirement a few months earlier."

Equifax_Inc.," Equifax Inc. Type Public company Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;EFX S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Credit risk assessment Founded 1899 Headquarters Atlanta, Georgia, United States Area served Worldwide Key people Rick Smith (Chairman and CEO) Revenue US$ 2.304 billion (2013) Operating income US$ 611.2 million (2013) Net income US$ 351.8 million (2013) Total assets US$ 4.54 billion (2013) Total equity US$ 2.34 billion (2013) Number of employees 7,000 (2014) The company later expanded into commercial credit reports on companies in the US, Canada and the UK, where it came into competition with companies such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet and Experian. The insurance reporting was phased out. The company also had a division selling specialist credit information to the insurance industry but spun off this service, including the Comprehensive Loss Underwriting Exchange (CLUE) database as ChoicePoint in 1997. The company formerly offered digital certification services, which it sold to GeoTrust in September 2001. In the same year, Equifax spun off its payment services division, forming the publicly listed company Certegy, which subsequently acquired Fidelity National Information Services in 2006. Certegy effectively became a subsidiary of Fidelity National Financial as a result of this reverse acquisition merger (See Certegy and Fidelity National Information Services for further information). In October 2010, Equifax acquired Anakam, an identity verification software company. Equifax purchased eThority, a business intelligence (BI) company headquartered in Charleston, South Carolina in October 2011. eThority is partnering with TALX, a St. Louis-based business unit of Equifax, and will remain in Charleston.  Business customers include retailers, insurance firms, healthcare providers, utilities, government agencies, as well as banks, credit unions, personal and specialty finance companies and other financial institutions. Equifax sells businesses credit reports, analytics, demographic data, and software. Credit reports provide detailed information on the personal credit and payment history of individuals, indicating how they have honored financial obligations such as paying bills or repaying a loan. Credit grantors use this information to decide what sort of products or services to offer their customers, and on what terms. Equifax also provides commercial credit reports, similar to Dun &amp; Bradstreet, containing financial and non financial data on businesses of all sizes. Equifax collects and provides data through the NCTUE, an exchange of non credit data including consumer payment history on telco and utility accounts. From 1999, Equifax began offering services to the credit consumer sector in addition, such as credit fraud and identity theft prevention products. Equifax, and other credit monitoring agencies are required by law to provide US residents with one free credit file disclosure every 12 months; the Annualcreditreport.com website incorporates data from US Equifax credit records."

The company offers colocation and interconnection solutions and related services to enterprises, content companies, systems integrators and 1,100+ network service providers worldwide. Equinix data centers are also home to more than 500 cloud service providers, and the company operates the Equinix Cloud Exchange, a service enabled by a proprietary software that allows customers to connect to multiple clouds simultaneously. Equinix operates 145+ data centers (which it calls ""International Business Exchanges"" – IBXs) across 40 major metropolitan areas in 15 countries on five continents. The company touts its broad geographic reach as a key differentiator, saying it allows its customers to place equipment in close proximity to employees, customers, partners and population centers. The company's Performance Hub offering enables customers to place corporate IT resources near large user populations in data centers connected to many networks and clouds. Contents 1 History 1.1 ALOG Data Centers of Brazil 2 Data centers 2.1 International Business Exchanges 2.2 Data Centers expansion in Brazil 2.3 Data center (IBX) locations 3 Customers 4 See also 5 References 6 External links History Also in 2015, Equinix converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) in a move to gain tax advantages and enhance shareholder value by offering a regular dividend. In January 2016, Equinix announced that it had completed the acquisition of TelecityGroup plc in a transaction valued at approximately $3.8 billion (£2.6 billion). The addition of TelecityGroup’s 40+ data centers more than doubled Equinix’s capacity in Europe, fortifying its position as the largest retail colocation provider in the region. The acquisition expanded the company’s interconnection platform in key European markets. It also added critical network and cloud density in order to better serve enterprise customers who viewed interconnection as a core IT design principle and were increasingly moving to highly interconnected, global data centers to accelerate business performance and innovation. ALOG Data Centers of Brazil Chairman Peter Van Camp describes Equinix International Business Exchanges (IBXs) as ""international airports where passengers from many different airlines make connections to get to their final destinations"". Equinix IBXs peer IP traffic to over 90% of the world's Internet routes. Their Internet Exchanges (IXs) route Internet traffic between over 1,000 telecommunications networks worldwide. In 2013, Equinix, still under the name of ALOG Data Centers of Brazil, launched its second data center in Rio de Janeiro and the fourth in the country. The initial investment was R$40&#160;million (BRL), and the new data center was the only one in the city to have Tier III certification. The data center had a projected area of 15,000 square meters for container data centers and antenna installer. In 2014, the data center in Tamboré (SP) was the first in Brazil to install a new cooling technology that takes advantage of free cooling, used nine precision air conditioning units, and was estimated to reduce the infrastructure energy costs by 30% to 60%. Data center (IBX) locations Equinix serves more than 6,300 customers worldwide.

This was followed by a Spirit of Achievement Award from Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University in 1968. In that year, the company expanded again, opening Clinique Laboratories, Inc. Clinique was the first dermatologist guided (Dr. Norman Orentreich), allergy tested, fragrance-free cosmetic brand created by Estée Lauder. Estée Lauder's Clinique brand became the first women's cosmetic company to introduce a second line for men when, in 1976, they began a separate line called ""Skin Supplies for Men"", which continues to be sold at Clinique counters worldwide. In 1981, the company's products became available in the Soviet Union. In February 2004, the company's teen-oriented jane business was sold; in April 2006, the professional-quality Stila brand, which Estée Lauder purchased in 1999, was sold. The company has had sometimes iconic spokesmodels, sometimes referred to simply as 'faces'. Past 'faces' for Estée Lauder include Karen Graham, Bruce Boxleitner, Shaun Casey, Willow Bay, Paulina Porizkova, Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, Anja Rubik, and actress Gwyneth Paltrow. As of 2008, Estée Lauder sold its products in department stores across the world and has a chain of freestanding retail outlets. On July 1, 2010, the company acquired Smashbox Beauty Cosmetics, Inc., a brand created in Smashbox Studios in Culver City, California by brothers Dean and Davis Factor (as in Max). (the end of the fiscal year), The Estée Lauder Companies had sales of more than $10.9 billion. As of 2014 87% of the company stock is owned by the members of the Lauder family. Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign (BCA) In October 1992, the BCA campaign was launched by Evelyn Lauder (Estée's daughter in law) who co-created the ""Pink Ribbon"" with SELF magazine as a symbol of breast health. Since then, millions of people globally have heard the message about the importance of breast health and early detection can save lives. The Estée Lauder Companies’ annual Breast Cancer Awareness campaign involves all of the 18 brands that make up the Estée Lauder Companies. They collectively represent The Breast Cancer Research Foundation’s first and largest corporate supporter. Estée's daughter-in-law created BCRF's signature pink ribbon. Over $10&#160;million were raised for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation between 1993 and summer 2003. Another $1&#160;million were raised from their retail partners between July 2002 and summer 2003. In June 2003, the San Francisco-based Queers Undermining Israeli Terrorism (QUIT) took up the boycott with their ""Estée Slaughter"" campaign. ^ a b ""ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES - Investor Relations - SEC Filings"".

(September 2008) Eversource Energy Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;ES S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Utility Founded 1966 Headquarters Hartford, Connecticut, USA and Boston, Massachusetts, USA  Products transmission, distribution and generation Website eversource.com Eversource Energy (formerly known as Northeast Utilities) is a publicly traded, Fortune 500 energy company headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut and Boston, Massachusetts, with several regulated subsidiaries offering retail electricity and natural gas service to more than 3.6 million ES was formed on July 1, 1966, with the merger of Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&amp;P) (formed in 1917), Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO)(formed in 1886), and the Hartford Electric Light Company (formed in 1878) under a single parent company, creating the first new multi-state public utility holding company since the enactment of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. In 1967, Holyoke Water Power Company (HWP)(formed in 1859) joined the NU System, and in 1992 the Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) (formed in 1926) followed. In 1999 Con Edison and Northeast Utilities entered merger negotiations and the companies began preparations to merge, but the deal fell apart in 2001 when Con Edison backed away from the merger after Connecticut's Attorney General Richard Blumenthal threatened lawsuits to block it. The deal would have created one of the largest utilities in the United States. PSNH continued to operate regulated hydroelectric and fossil fuel generation assets to serve its default/basic service customers that did not choose a competitive supplier (the state of New Hampshire had not required divestiture of its generation assets). Before its rebranding to the Eversource Energy name in February 2015 the company operated six main subsidiaries: CL&amp;P, PSNH, WMECO, Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas. As a large utility company, Eversource and its subsidiaries are regulated by state and federal regulators. The company has contributed to the election campaigns of several Connecticut politicians. Among organizations, the company (known as Northeast Utilities at the time) was the third biggest contributor to Representative Christopher Murphy (CT-5), the fourth biggest contributor to Representative Joe Courtney (CT-2), and the sixth biggest contributor to Representative John Larson (CT-1), $11,800 to Rep. Jim Himes (CT-4), and $6,000 to Rep. Rosa DeLauro (CT-3). As Northeast Utilities the company signed on a joint venture with Hydro-Québec and NSTAR to build a new High-voltage direct current (HVDC) line from Windsor, Quebec (connecting with the Quebec grid) to a location in Franklin, New Hampshire. It is projected that the line will either run in an existing right-of-way adjacent to the HVDC line that runs through New Hampshire, or it will connect to a right-of-way in northern New Hampshire that will run through the White Mountains. This 180- to 190-mile line, projected to carry 1,200 megawatts, will carry electricity to approximately one million homes. the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is now investigating the utility for having transmission rates that appear to be “unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory or preferential”. Eversource Energy has participated in a number of projects to improve the reliability of the power grid in southwest Connecticut. The first project was construction of the $350 million 345 kilovolt Bethel-Norwalk transmission line through the western part of the state, and was constructed entirely by the company when it was still known as Northeast Utilities. With United Illuminating, an upgrade to the 69-mile (112&#160;km), 345 kilovolt Middletown-Norwalk transmission line was energized in 2009 at a cost of $900 million. In 2013, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, a component of the ongoing New England East-West Solution, was energized at a cost of $795 million. The project addressed numerous reliability issues with the Springfield, MA area's 115 kv transmission system by constructing two new 345 kv lines to the Agawam substation; one line north to Ludlow and the other south to North Bloomfield, Connecticut. The new 345 kv corridor added a new strong interface between Massachusetts and Connecticut. The project also involved rebuilding all of the 115 kv lines along the transmission corridor between South Agawam and Ludlow to increase their capacities, building a new 115 kv transmission substation in East Springfield (Cadwell), replacing the Fairmont 115 kv transmission substation in Chicopee with a new substation across the street, and configuring a new 115 kv line from South Agawam to Southwick using a combination of both new and old line segments of the former 115 kv path between Agawam and North Bloomfield. The new Cadwell and Fairmont switching stations allowed a number of three-terminal 115 kv lines to be broken up into two-terminal lines. Finally, the project allowed a problematic underground 115 kv transmission path through the city of Springfield that was vulnerable to thermal overloads to be removed from service by breaking it in half at the middle. The underground lines now function solely to supply the distribution load served out of the Breckwood substation in Springfield. A previously proposed costly project that would have replaced the underground cables is no longer necessary. On November 20, 2013, cutover of 115kv lines to the new Fairmont Switching Station was complete marking substantial completion of the GSRP.

(ExxonMobil) is an American multinational oil and gas corporation headquartered in Irving, Texas. It is the largest direct descendant of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company, and was formed on November 30, 1999 by the merger of Exxon (formerly Standard Oil Company of New Jersey) and Mobil (formerly the Standard Oil Company of New York). The world's 8th largest company by revenue, ExxonMobil is also the third largest publicly traded company by market capitalization. ExxonMobil's reserves were 25.2&#160;billion BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) at the end of 2013 and the 2007 rates of production were expected to last more than 14 years. With 37 oil refineries in 21 countries constituting a combined daily refining capacity of 6.3 million barrels (1,000,000&#160;m3), ExxonMobil is the largest refiner in the world, In 1890, Standard Oil, together with local ship merchants in Bremen established Deutsch-Amerikanische Petroleum Gesellschaft (later: Esso A.G.). The reputation of Standard Oil in the public eye suffered badly after publication of Ida M. Tarbell's classic exposé The History of the Standard Oil Co. in 1904, leading to a growing outcry for the government to take action against the company. By 1911, with public outcry at a climax, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that Standard Oil must be dissolved and split into 34&#160;companies. Two of these companies were Jersey Standard (""Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey""), which eventually became Exxon, and Socony (""Standard Oil Co. of New York""), which eventually became Mobil. In the following years it acquired or established Tropical Oil Company of Colombia (1920), Standard Oil Company of Venezuela (1921), and Creole Petroleum Company of Venezuela (1928). In 1928, Socony joined the Turkish Petroleum Company (Iraq Petroleum Company). In 1927, Jersey Standard signed a 25-years cooperation agreement with IG Farben for the coal hydrogenation research in the United States. Jersey Standard assumed this cooperation to be beneficial as it believed the United States oil reserves to be exhausted in the near future and that the coal hydrogenation would give an access for producing synthetic fuels. It erected synthetic fuel plants in Bayway, Baton Rouge, and Baytown (unfinished). The interest in hydrogenation evaporated after discovery of the East Texas Oil Field. In 1948, Jersey Standard and Socony-Vacuum acquired interests in the Arab-American Oil Company (Aramco). Humble Oil became a wholly owned subsidiary of Jersey Standard and was reorganized into the United States marketing division of Jersey Standard in 1959. In 1967, Humble Oil purchased all remaining Signal stations from Standard Oil Company of California (Chevron) In 1969, Humble Oil opened a new refinery in Benicia, California. Mobil Chemical Company was established in 1960 and Exxon Chemical Company (first named Enjay Chemicals) in 1965. In late 1960s, Jersey Standard entered into the nuclear industry. In 1969, it created a subsidiary, Jersey Nuclear Company (later: Exxon Nuclear Company), for manufacturing and marketing of uranium fuel, which was to be fabricated from uranium concentrates mined by the mineral department of Humble Oil (later: Exxon Minerals Company). In 1980, Exxon merged its assets in the mineral industry into newly established Exxon Minerals (later ExxonMobil Coal and Minerals). Exxon sold the Exxon Building (1251 Avenue of the Americas), its former headquarters in Rockefeller Center, to a unit of Mitsui Real Estate Development Co. Ltd. in 1986 for $610 million, and in 1989, movedg its headquarters from Manhattan, New York City to the Las Colinas area of Irving, Texas. John Walsh, president of Exxon subsidiary Friendswood Development Company, stated that Exxon left New York because the costs were too high. On March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez oil tanker struck Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska and spilled more than 11&#160;million US gallons (42,000&#160;m3) of crude oil. The Exxon Valdez oil spill was the second largest in U.S. history, and in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez incident, the U.S. Congress passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. An initial award of $5&#160;billion USD punitive was reduced to $507.5&#160;million by the US Supreme Court in June 2008, and distributions of this award have commenced. In 1994, Mobil established a subsidiary MEGAS (Mobil European Gas) which became responsible for its Mobil's natural gas operations in Europe. In 1998, Exxon and Mobil signed a US$73.7&#160;billion merger agreement forming a new company called Exxon Mobil Corp. (ExxonMobil), the largest oil company and the third largest company in the world. This was the largest corporate merger that time. At the time of the merge, Exxon was the world largest energy company while Mobil was the second largest oil and gas company in the United States. The merger announcement followed shortly after merger of British Petroleum and Amoco which was the largest industrial merger that time. The Federal Trade Commission required to sell 2,431&#160;gas stations in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic (1,740), California (360), Texas (319), and Guam (12). In addition, ExxonMobil should sell its Benicia Refinery in California, terminal operations in Boston, the Washington, D.C. area and Guam, interest in the Colonial pipeline, Mobil's interest in the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, Exxon's jet turbine oil business, and give-up the option to buy Tosco Corporation gas stations.

(January 2016) In 2005, ExxonMobil surpassed Wal-Mart as the world's largest publicly held corporation when measured by revenue, although Wal-Mart remained the largest by number of employees. ExxonMobil's $340&#160;billion revenues in 2005 were a 25.5 percent increase over their 2004 revenues. In 2006, Wal-Mart recaptured the lead with revenues of $348.7&#160;billion against ExxonMobil's $335.1. ExxonMobil continued to lead the world in both profits ($39.5&#160;billion in 2006) and market value ($460.43&#160;billion).

The Political Economy Research Institute ranks ExxonMobil sixth among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (15.5&#160;million pounds in 2005) and toxicity of the emissions. Main article: Exxon Valdez oil spill The March 24, 1989, Exxon Valdez oil spill resulted in the discharge of approximately 11&#160;million US gallons (42,000&#160;m3) of oil into Prince William Sound, oiling 1,300 miles (2,100&#160;km) of the remote Alaskan coastline. The Valdez spill is 36th worst oil spill in history in terms of sheer volume. The State of Alaska's Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council stated that the spill ""is widely considered the number one spill worldwide in terms of damage to the environment"". that the spill consists of 17 to 30&#160;million US gallons (64,000 to 114,000&#160;m3) of petroleum products from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century. The largest portion of these operations were by ExxonMobil or its predecessors. By comparison, the Exxon Valdez oil spill was approximately 11&#160;million US gallons (42,000&#160;m3). ExxonMobil originally reported to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality(LDEQ) that 1,364 pounds of material had been leaked. On June 18, Baton Rouge refinery representatives told the LDEQ that ExxonMobil's chemical team determined that the June 14 spill was actually a level 2 incident classification which means that a significant response to the leak was required. In April 2012, a crude oil pipeline, from the Exxon Corp Baton Rouge Refinery, burst and spilled at least 1,900 barrels of oil (80,000 gallons) in the rivers of Point Coupee Parish, Louisiana, shutting down the Exxon Corp Baton Refinery for a few days. Regulators opened an investigation in response to the pipeline oil spill. As a precaution against a possible explosion, officials in Laurel, Montana evacuated about 140 people on Saturday (July 2) just after midnight, then allowed them to return at 4&#160;am Main article: 2013 Mayflower oil spill On March 29, 2013, the Pegasus Pipeline, owned by ExxonMobil and carrying Canadian Wabasca heavy crude, ruptured in Mayflower, Arkansas, releasing about 3,190 barrels (507&#160;m3) of oil and forcing the evacuation of 22&#160;homes. Main article: Sakhalin-I Scientists and environmental groups voice concern that the Sakhalin-I oil and gas project in the Russian Far East, operated by an ExxonMobil subsidiary, Exxon Neftegas Limited (ENL), Main article: Accusations of ExxonMobil human rights violations in Indonesia ExxonMobil is the target of human rights activists for actions taken by the corporation in the Indonesian territory of Aceh. In June 2001, a lawsuit against ExxonMobil was filed in the Federal District Court of the District of Columbia under the Alien Tort Claims Act. The suit alleges that the ExxonMobil knowingly assisted human rights violations, including torture, murder and rape, by employing and providing material support to Indonesian military forces, who committed the alleged offenses during civil unrest in Aceh. Human rights complaints involving Exxon's (Exxon and Mobil had not yet merged) relationship with the Indonesian military first arose in 1992; the company denies these accusations and filed a motion to dismiss the suit, which was denied in 2008 by a federal judge."

F5's first product was a load balancer called BIG-IP. When a server went down or became overloaded, BIG-IP directed traffic away from that server to other servers that could handle the load. In June 1999, the company went public as F5 Networks and was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange (NASDAQ: FFIV). As it was in 1999, corporate focus in 2013 remains on providing network intelligence that enables customers to respond quickly to change, streamline business processes, reduce costs, and provide differentiated offerings that help increase revenue. Through internal development and acquisitions, F5 extended its reach beyond load balancing, producing a range of integrated products for Application Delivery Networking. These products seek to improve the delivery of web-based applications by attempting to make them run faster and more securely.

Version 9.0 was significantly different than the previous versions of BIG-IP. The significant changes include: Moved from BSD to Linux to handle sys management functions (disks, logging, bootup, console access, etc.) Creation of a Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to directly talk to the networking hardware and handle all network activities. iControl Application Programming Interface (API): an open API for management of the BIG-IP iRules: a TCL-based scripting language allowing arbitrary manipulation of traffic flowing through the BIG-IP, including real-time modification of said data. FirePass BIG-IQ is an emerging control plane for BIG-IP devices. F5 describes BIG-IQ as an intelligent framework for managing BIG-IP devices and application services, irrespective of their form factors (hardware, software or cloud) or deployment model (on-premises, private/public cloud or hybrid). BIG-IQ supports integration with other ecosystem participants such as public cloud providers, and orchestration engines through cloud connectors and through a comprehensive set of open RESTful APIs. Complementing the orchestration capability of BIG-IQ is a multi-tenant approach to management.

According to The Harvard Crimson, the site was comparable to Hot or Not and used ""photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the 'hotter' person"" To accomplish this, Zuckerberg hacked into protected areas of Harvard's computer network and copied private dormitory ID images. Harvard did not have a student ""Facebook"" (a directory with photos and basic information) at the time, although individual houses had been issuing their own paper facebooks since the mid-1980s, and Harvard's longtime Freshman Yearbook was colloquially referred to as the ""Freshman Facebook"". Facemash attracted 450 visitors and 22,000 photo-views in its first four hours online. for 1.2 million shares (worth $300 million at Facebook's IPO). Eduardo Saverin (business aspects), Dustin Moskovitz (programmer), Andrew McCollum (graphic artist), and Chris Hughes joined Zuckerberg to help promote the website. In March 2004, Facebook expanded to the universities of Columbia, Stanford, and Yale. (At the time, high-school networks required an invitation to join.) In late 2007, Facebook had 100,000 business pages (pages which allowed companies to promote themselves and attract customers). These started as group pages, but a new concept called company pages was planned. In November 2010, based on SecondMarket Inc. (an exchange for privately held companies' shares), Facebook's value was $41&#160;billion. The company had slightly surpassed eBay to become the third largest American web company after Google and Amazon.com. The shares began trading on May 18; the stock struggled to stay above the IPO price for most of the day, but set a record for the trading volume of an IPO (460 million shares). Billboard on the Thomson Reuters building welcomes Facebook to NASDAQ, 2012 On May 22, 2012, the Yahoo! Finance website reported that Facebook's lead underwriters, Morgan Stanley (MS), JP Morgan (JPM), and Goldman Sachs (GS), cut their earnings forecasts for the company in the middle of the IPO process. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro, and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Chairman Rick Ketchum, called for a review of the circumstances surrounding the IPO. The other underwriters (MS, JPM, GS), Facebook's CEO and board, and NASDAQ also faced litigation after numerous lawsuits were filed, while SEC and FINRA both launched investigations. A July 2013 Wall Street Journal article identified the Facebook IPO as the cause of a change in the U.S.' national economic statistics, as the local government area of the company's headquarters, San Mateo County, California, became the top wage-earning county in the country after the fourth quarter of 2012. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the average weekly wage in the county was US$3,240, 107% higher than the previous year. It noted the wages were ""the equivalent of $168,000 a year, and more than 50% higher than the next-highest county, New York County (better known as Manhattan), at $2,107 a week, or roughly $110,000 a year."" Facebook was announced as a member of The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) in October 2013, when the A4AI was launched. The A4AI is a coalition of public and private organisations that includes Google, Intel and Microsoft. Led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease Internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income. Facebook announced Q4 2013 earnings of $523 million (20 cents per share), an increase of $64 million from the previous year, Key management personnel consist of: Chris Cox (Chief Product Officer), Sandberg (COO), and Zuckerberg (Chairman and CEO). Mike Vernal is considered to be the company's top engineer. Revenue Revenues (in millions US$) Year Revenue Growth 2004 $6999400000000000000♠0.4 Facebook generally has a lower clickthrough rate (CTR) for advertisements than most major Web sites. According to BusinessWeek.com, banner advertisements on Facebook have generally received one-fifth the number of clicks compared to those on the Web as a whole, although specific comparisons can reveal a much larger disparity. For example, while Google users click on the first advertisement for search results an average of 8% of the time (80,000 clicks for every one million searches), Facebook's users click on advertisements an average of 0.04% of the time (400 clicks for every one million pages). Chart of Facebook's Stock The company released its own set of revenue data at the end of January 2014 and claimed: Revenues of US$2.59 billion were generated for the three months ending December 31, 2013; earnings per share were 31 cents; revenues of US$7.87 billion were made for the entirety of 2013; and Facebook's annual profit for 2013 was US$1.5 billion. During the same time, independent market research firm eMarketer released data in which Facebook accounted for 5.7 per cent of all global digital ad revenues in 2013 (Google's share was 32.4 per cent). which would supplement its operations in California, Dublin in Ireland as well as at Austin, Texas. A custom-built data center with substantially reduced (""38% less"") power consumption compared to existing Facebook data centers opened in April 2011 in Prineville, Oregon. Facebook used a combination platform based on HBase to store data across distributed machines. Using a tailing architecture, new events are stored in log files, and the logs are tailed. The system rolls these events up and writes them into storage. The User Interface then pulls the data out and displays it to users. Facebook handles requests as AJAX behavior. These requests are written to a log file using Scribe (developed by Facebook). Data is read from these log files using Ptail, an internally built tool to aggregate data from multiple Scribe stores. It tails the log files and pulls data out (thus the name). Ptail data is separated out into three streams so they can eventually be sent to their own clusters in different data centers (Plugin impression, News feed impressions, Actions (plugin + news feed)). Puma is used to manage periods of high data flow (Input/Output or IO). Data is processed in batches to lessen the number of times needed to read and write under high demand periods (A hot article will generate a lot of impressions and news feed impressions which will cause huge data skews). Batches are taken every 1.5 seconds, limited by memory used when creating a hash table. After this, data is output in PHP format (compiled with HipHop for PHP). The backend is written in Java and Thrift is used as the messaging format so PHP programs can query Java services. Caching solutions are used to make the web pages display more quickly. The more and longer data is cached the less realtime it is. The data is then sent to MapReduce servers so it can be queried via Hive. This also serves as a backup plan as the data can be recovered from Hive. Raw logs are removed after a period of time. Messaging A new Messaging platform, codenamed ""Project Titan"", was launched on November 15, 2010. Described as a ""Gmail killer"" by some publications, the system allows users to directly communicate with each other via Facebook using several different methods (including a special email address, text messaging, or through the Facebook website or mobile app)—no matter what method is used to deliver a message, they are contained within single threads in a unified inbox. As with other Facebook features, users can adjust from whom they can receive messages—including just friends, friends of friends, or from anyone. In 2007, Facebook launched Facebook Pages (also called ""Fan Pages"" by users) to allow ""users to interact and affiliate with businesses and organizations in the same way they interact with other Facebook user profiles"". On November 6, 2007, more than 100,000 Facebook pages were launched. Many new smartphones offer access to Facebook services through either their Web browsers or applications. An official Facebook application is available for the operating systems Android, iOS, webOS, and Firefox OS. Nokia and Research In Motion both provide Facebook applications for their own mobile devices. As of January 2015, 745 million active users access Facebook through mobile devices every day. Sherr, Ian (January 28, 2015). ""Facebook mobile users hit new highs, revenue jumps"". Cnet. Retrieved March 2, 2015.&#160; In May 2014, Facebook introduced a feature to allow users to ask for information not disclosed by other users on their profiles. If a user does not provide key information, such as location, hometown, or relationship status, other users can use a new 'ask' button to send a message asking about that item to the user in a single click. Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users). MySpace allows users to decorate their profiles using HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), while Facebook allows only plain text. Pokes, which allows users to send a virtual ""poke"" to each other (a notification then tells a user that they have been poked); Facebook requires a user's name and profile picture (if applicable) to be accessible by everyone. Users can control who sees other information they have shared, as well as who can find them in searches, through their privacy settings. In regional Internet markets, Facebook penetration is highest in North America (69 percent), followed by Middle East-Africa (67 percent), Latin America (58 percent), Europe (57 percent), and Asia-Pacific (17 percent). Date Users (in millions) Days later Monthly growth In early 2010, Openbook was established, an avowed parody (and privacy advocacy) website United States with 151.8 million members India with 108.9 million members Brazil with 70.5 million members Indonesia with 60.3 million members Mexico with 44.4 million members Facebook's popularity throughout the world (especially as a tool for political movements or procrastination) has led to some countries and employers blocking access to the site. All of the above total 309 million members or about 38.6 percent of Facebook's 1 billion worldwide members. Users quitting A 2013 study examined the reasons users eventually quit the site. It found the most common reasons were privacy concerns (48%), general dissatisfaction with Facebook (14%), negative aspects regarding Facebook friends (13%) and the feeling of getting addicted to Facebook (6%). Facebook quitters were found to be more concerned about privacy, more addicted to the Internet and more conscientious. Shortly thereafter, on July 3, 2014, USA Today reported that the privacy watchdog group Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) had filed a formal complaint with the Federal Trade claiming that Facebook had broken the law when it conducted the study on the emotions of its users without their knowledge or consent. In its complaint, EPIC alleged that Facebook had deceived it users by secretly conducting a psychological experiment on their emotions: ""At the time of the experiment, Facebook did not state in the Data Use Policy that user data would be used for research purposes. Facebook also failed to inform users that their personal information would be shared with researchers."" Beyond the ethical concerns, other scholars criticized the methods and reporting of the study's findings. John Grohol, writing at PsycCentral, argued that despite its title and claims of ""emotional contagion,"" this study did not look at emotions at all. Instead, its authors used an application (called ""Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count"" or LIWC 2007) that simply counted positive and negative words in order to infer users' sentiments. He wrote that a shortcoming of the LIWC tool is that it does not understand negations. Hence, the tweet ""I am not happy"" would be scored as positive: ""Since the LIWC 2007 ignores these subtle realities of informal human communication, so do the researchers."" Grohol concluded that given these subtleties, the effect size of the findings are little more than a ""statistical blip."" Kramer et al. (2014) found a 0.07% — that's not 7 percent, that's 1/15th of one percent!! — decrease in negative words in people's status updates when the number of negative posts on their Facebook news feed decreased. Do you know how many words you'd have to read or write before you've written one less negative word due to this effect? Probably thousands. The consequences of the controversy are pending (be it FTC or court proceedings) but it did prompt an ""Editorial Expression of Concern"" from its publisher, the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, as well as an blog posting from OkCupid that ""We experiment on human beings!"" In September 2014, law professor James Grimmelmann argued that the actions of both companies were ""illegal, immoral, and mood-altering"" and filed notices with the Maryland Attorney General and Cornell Institutional Review Board. ""Free basics"" controversy in India In February 2016, TRAI ruled against differential data pricing for limited services from mobile phone operators effectively ending zero-rating platforms in India. Zero rating provides access to limited number of websites for no charge to the end user. Net-neutrality supporters from India(SaveTheInternet.in) brought out the negative implications of Facebook Free Basic program and spread awareness to the public. Political impact Further information: Social media and political communication in the United States A man during the 2011 Egyptian protests carrying a card saying ""Facebook,#jan25, The Egyptian Social Network"". In February 2008, a Facebook group called ""One Million Voices Against FARC"" organized an event in which hundreds of thousands of Colombians marched in protest against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known as the FARC (from the group's Spanish name)."

In June 2009, FedEx began a campaign against United Parcel Service (UPS) and the Teamsters union, accusing its competitor of receiving a bailout in an advertising campaign called ""Brown Bailout"". FedEx claimed that signing the Federal Aviation Administration re-authorization bill, which would let some of its workers unionize more easily (and, according to the Memphis-based company, ""could expose  customers at any time to local work stoppages that interrupted the flow of their time-sensitive, high-value shipments”), According to the U.S. Department of Justice, ""FedEx is alleged to have knowingly and intentionally conspired to distribute controlled substances and prescription drugs, including Phendimetrazine (Schedule III); Ambien, Phentermine, Diazepam, and Alprazolam (Schedule IV), to customers who had no legitimate medical need for them based on invalid prescriptions issued by doctors who were acting outside the usual course of professional practice.""

Type Public company (NASDAQ:&#160;FSLR) S&amp;P 500 Component Founded 1999 (as First Solar Holdings, LLC) Headquarters Tempe, Arizona, U.S. Key people Michael J. Ahearn, Chairman of Supervisory Board, James Hughes, CEO Revenue US$3.39 billion (FY 2014) Operating income US$424.16 million (FY 2014) Net income US$396.91 million (FY 2014) Total assets US$6.72 billion (FY 2014) Total equity US$5.02 billion (FY 2014) Number of employees 5,600 (2012) Website www.firstsolar.com First Solar, Inc. is an American photovoltaic (PV) manufacturer of rigid thin film modules, or solar panels, and a provider of utility-scale PV power plants and supporting services that include finance, construction, maintenance and end-of-life panel recycling. First Solar uses cadmium telluride (CdTe) as a semiconductor to produce CdTe-panels, that are competing successfully with conventional crystalline silicon technology. First Solar manufactures cadmium telluride (CdTe)-based photovoltaic (PV) modules, which produce electricity with a thin CdTe film on glass. In 1984, inventor and entrepreneur Harold McMaster founded Glasstech Solar. McMaster foresaw the opportunity to manufacture low-cost, thin film cells on a large scale. After trying amorphous silicon, he shifted to CdTe at the urging of Jim Nolan and founded Solar Cells, Inc., (SCI) in 1990  John T. Walton joined the Board of the new company, and Michael J. Ahearn of True North became the CEO of the newly minted First Solar. In its early years, First Solar module efficiencies were modest, about 7 percent. First Solar launched production of commercial products in 2002 and reached an annual production of 25 megawatts (MW) in 2005. At the end of 2009, First Solar had surpassed an annual production rate of one gigawatt (GW) On April 17, 2012, First Solar announced it would restructure operations worldwide. This restructuring process included phasing out operations in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany and idling four production lines in Kulim, Malaysia. Historically, First Solar sold its products to solar project developers, system integrators, and independent power producers. Early sales were primarily in Germany because of strong incentives for solar enacted in the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) of 2000 (cp. Solar power in Germany). In 2011, the company had 36 production lines with 2,376 megawatts of annual manufacturing capacity. Each line had a 66-megawatt capacity. The first factory was built in Ohio, followed by a four-line manufacturing plant in Frankfurt (Oder), Germany. In April 2007, the firm announced the construction of a plant in Kulim Hi-Tech Park, Malaysia, which was expanded to six plants in 2010. In October 2008, the firm began an expansion of its facility in Perrysburg, Ohio, completed in 2010, In February 2012, it postponed commissioning of a new U.S. plant in Mesa, AZ until demand develops. In May 2012, four lines in Malaysia were shut down indefinitely and plans to shutter the facility in Germany were announced.

Historically, the low cost of First Solar’s modules has been the key to its market performance. The use of cadmium telluride instead of silicon allowed it to achieve a significantly lower module cost ($0.67 per watt), A new study by the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR) finds that the Walton family is funding nearly two dozen anti-solar groups — such as the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) and Americans for Prosperity, which are waging state and national fights to roll back clean energy policies — while a Walton-owned energy company is pushing for regulations that hinder the growth of rooftop solar power. Rooftop solar has been cited as a tremendous opportunity to accelerate the transition to renewable power, save money for homeowners, and create tens of thousands of new jobs, but, as the report details, the Waltons’ interventions and spending are a very real threat to this future. Three months later FirstSolar filed comments with the Arizona Corporation Commission similarly arguing that utility-scale solar was being treated unfairly, partly due to subsidies being given asymmetrically to roof-top solar. ACC then planned a new fee for rooftop PV owners who participate in net metering, as proposed by utility Arizona Public Service (APS). The new proposal would have raised rooftop solar installations fees from $5 to $21 per month, saving other APS customers $0.23 per month instead of costing them more. APS claims the real cost of rooftop solar to the grid infrastructure is $68 per month. The proposal has been placed on hold by an ACC judge. Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Seih Al-Dahal, UAE, includes a 13&#160;MWDC solar power plant built by First Solar for the Dubai Electricity &amp; Water Authority (DEWA). Stadtwerke Trier (SWT) in Trier, Germany, is one of the world’s largest thin-film solar plants. As of February 2009, it was estimated the facility would produce over 9 GWh per year, which would supply power to more than 2,400 homes each year. Additionally, it is estimated the facility will conserve 100,000 tons of CO2 over 20 years. Waldpolenz Solar Park near Leipzig, Germany, is the largest thin-film PV power system in the world. Built and developed by Juwi Group, it has a capacity of 40&#160;MW. The facility became fully operational in 2008. In December 2009, the Lieberose Photovoltaic Park, Germany’s biggest conversion land project (126 hectares) on a former military training area, was opened with an output of 53&#160;MW. The solar park uses 700,000 solar modules."

Its subsidiaries and affiliates are involved in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity, as well as energy management and other energy-related services. Its ten electric utility operating companies comprise the United States' largest investor-owned utility, based on serving 6 million customers within a 67,000-square-mile (170,000&#160;km2) area of Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. Its generation subsidiaries control more than 23,000 megawatts of capacity, and its distribution lines span over 194,000 miles. In 2013, FirstEnergy ranked 181 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest public corporations in America. Contents 1 History 1.1 Ohio Edison 1.2 Centerior 1.3 GPU 1.4 Allegheny Energy 2 Generating capacity 3 Environmental record 3.1 Little Blue Run 4 Executives 5 Notable accidents and incidents 6 References 7 External links History That same month the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) initiated an investigation into the reliability of FirstEnergy's energy transmission in the context of possible plant shutdowns and prior problems with Centerior. In 2001, FirstEnergy merged with GPU, Inc., the owner of Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Company, Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec), and Metropolitan Edison Company (Met-Ed). Ohio Edison Ohio Edison Company (formerly OEC on the NYSE) Centerior Energy Corporation (formerly CX on the NYSE) was formed in 1986 from the merger of two old operating companies. Centerior was based in Independence, Ohio and existed as a publicly traded holding company for only ten years, until its merger with Ohio Edison formed FirstEnergy in 1997: Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company, commonly known as The Illuminating Company, was a publicly traded operating company through 1986, until it merged with Toledo Edison to come under the control of Centerior. Having been acquired by 1929, by 1940 it had become one of ten major direct subsidiaries of North American Company, which in turn had once been one of the original 12 stocks listed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Toledo Edison Company (formerly TED on the NYSE) was a publicly traded utility operating company, until it merged to form Centerior in 1986. GPU General Public Utilities (formerly GPU on the NYSE) was a publicly traded utility holding company in Morristown, New Jersey. In 1996, the company was reorganized and renamed GPU, Inc. In 1996, it formed a new division as well, GPU Energy, which became the holding company for its three utility operating companies: Jersey Central Power and Light (JCP&amp;L) Pennsylvania Electric Company (Penelec) Metropolitan Edison (Met-Ed) In 2001, FirstEnergy Corporation, with its four utility operating companies, merged with GPU, Inc., bringing GPU's three additional operating companies into FirstEnergy as well. Through the 2001 acquisition of GPU, FirstEnergy also acquired: MYR Group (formerly MYR on the NYSE), a subsidiary that GPU had created as a publicly traded company in the 1996 reorganization, to install and maintain utility power lines and cellular telephone communications towers. Main article: Allegheny Energy Allegheny Energy was an electric utility serving customers in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia, and Maryland. Its regulated subsidiaries are West Penn Power (serving Southwestern and Central Pennsylvania), Monongahela Power (a.k.a. ""Mon Power"", serving Northern and Southern West Virginia), and The Potomac Edison Company (western Maryland, parts of eastern West Virginia, and northern Virginia). The electric generating plants are operated by subsidiary Allegheny Energy Supply Company and Monongahela Power. Before the formation of Allegheny Energy, the holding company was known as Allegheny Power System which had the three utility operating units. The brand name Allegheny Power was used on customer bills, trucks and company equipment starting in 1996. In 1997, the company attempted to merge with Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Light Company. The merger was withdrawn by both parties and both companies did not merge. In 1999, Allegheny Power purchased the West Virginia operations of UtiliCorp United's West Virginia Power. UtiliCorp purchased Virginia Electric and Power Company's (present day Dominion Resources) West Virginia service area in 1986 and renamed the acquired service area West Virginia Power. In February 2010, Allegheny Energy announced plans to merge with FirstEnergy. The merger was approved by stockholders of both companies, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and regulatory commissions in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. The merger was finalized when the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission approved the merger on February 24, 2011; the merger closed on February 25, 2011. And finally in November, FirstEnergy purchased the rights to develop a compressed-air electric generating plant in Norton, Ohio, which Ohio Governor Ted Strickland praised as ""an example of how we can leverage technology and our natural resources to grow our economy and ensure our energy future."" The Norton project, part of the company’s overall climate change strategy, has the potential to be expanded to up to 2,700 MW of capacity—the largest in the world by far. According to the Electric Power Research Institute, ""a compressed-air energy storage project of this size...could be a key component in integrating large-scale intermittent renewables (such as wind) onto the nation's grid system."" The Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission voted on January 16, 2004 to investigate Metropolitan Edison, Pennsylvania Electric and Pennsylvania Power (the former GPU companies) because their service reliability ""may have fallen below established standards"". On Friday, January 20, 2006, FirstEnergy acknowledged a cover-up of serious safety violations by former workers at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station, and accepted a plea bargain with the U.S. Department of Justice in lieu of possible federal criminal prosecution. The plea bargain relates to the March 2002 discovery of severe corrosion in the pressure vessel of the nuclear reactor, contained within the plant's containment building. In the agreement, the company agreed to pay fines of $23 million, with an additional $5 million to be contributed toward research on alternative energy sources and to Habitat for Humanity as well as to pay for costs related to the Federal investigation. In addition, two former employees and one former contractor were indicted for purposely deceiving Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) inspectors in multiple documents (including one videotape) over several years, hiding evidence that the reactor pressure vessel was being seriously corroded by boric acid. The maximum penalty for the three is 25 years in prison. The indictment also cites other employees as providing false information to inspectors, but does not name them. In 2005, the NRC identified two earlier incidents at Davis-Besse as being among the top five events (excluding the actual disaster at Three Mile Island) most likely to have resulted in a nuclear disaster in the event of a subsequent failure..

FMC received a contract to design and build amphibious landing vehicles tracked vehicles for the United States War Department in 1941. FMC ranked 64th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts. In 1961, the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Ships issued bids for a high performance amphibious ship-to-shore cargo carrier capable of moving over water at 35 knots (approx. 40&#160;mph) and over ground at the same speed. It had to carry five (5) tons of cargo across water, through the surf, across the beach, and inland. The vehicle also had to be quickly loaded and unloaded under combat conditions. FMC's Ordnance Division in San José, California built and tested two (2) prototypes named LVHX2 Landing Vehicle, Hydrofoil for the U.S. Marine Corps. These were the first amphibious landing vehicles to make use of hydrofoils for high speed ship-to-shore operation. Although the LVHX2 never went into production, the Marine Corps used the prototypes in their continuous research and development program to develop better equipment for amphibious assault operations. FMC later built the M113 (APC) Armored Personnel Carrier and the Bradley Fighting Vehicle as well as the XR311 at its former facility in Santa Clara, California. It also purchased the rights to manufacture some foreign military hardware, including the Brazilian EE-9 Cascavel, under license. The troubled development of the Bradley was satirized in the 1998 HBO movie The Pentagon Wars. In the movie FMC was fictionalized as A.O.C corporation. Bean also manufactured fire fighting equipment in the 1960s through the 1980s under the FMC and the Bean names. FMC also produced fire truck fire pumps and pumper bodies, and had an OEM arrangement with LTI (Ladder Towers Inc.) to market aerial ladders. In the early 1980s the fire apparatus division of FMC tried to expand its role in aerial ladders on fire trucks, leveraging the Link-Belt crane division. FMC was ultimately unsuccessful in its expansion into production of aerial ladders. The FMC Fire Apparatus division was also ultimately shut down in 1990. FMC plant in South Charleston, West Virginia, 1970 FMC 210 Skidder made by FMC In 1946, FMC bought out Bolens Lawn And Garden Equipment. FMC changed names again in 1948, becoming Food Machinery and Chemical Corporation. In 1961 the name was changed to FMC Corporation. In 1967, the FMC Corporation merged with the Link-Belt Company. The company produced FMC Link-Belt branded cranes and excavators. In 1986, the Link-Belt Construction Equipment Company was formed as a joint venture between FMC Corporation and Sumitomo Heavy Industries. Between 1965 and 1985 FMC was the owner of the Gunderson metal works in Oregon USA, during that period it was known as the 'Marine and Rail Equipment Division of FMC' (MRED), it was sold in 1985 to The Greenbrier Companies. In the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s (decade), FMC Corporation began spinning several of its divisions into separate companies, including United Defense and FMC Technologies, and selling its divisions, including the John Bean Company, now a subsidiary of Snap-on Equipment, a division of Snap-on.

It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the Ford brand and most luxury cars under the Lincoln brand. Ford also owns Brazilian SUV manufacturer, Troller, and Australian performance car manufacturer FPV. In the past it has also produced tractors and automotive components. Ford owns a 2.1% stake in Mazda of Japan, an 8% stake in Aston Martin of the United Kingdom, and a 49% stake in Jiangling of China. It also has a number of joint-ventures, one in China (Changan Ford Mazda), one in Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), one in Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), one in Turkey (Ford Otosan), and one in Russia (Ford Sollers). It is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family, although they have minority ownership. In 2011, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had marketed entry-level luxury cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938. During the financial crisis at the beginning of the 21st century, it was close to bankruptcy, but it has since returned to profitability. Ford is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker (preceded by General Motors) and the fifth-largest in the world based on 2010 vehicle sales.

The Ford Motor Company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 in cash from twelve investors, most notably John and Horace Dodge (who would later found their own car company). During its early years, the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on Mack Avenue and later its factory on Piquette Avenue in Detroit, Michigan. Groups of two or three men worked on each car, assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. Within a decade the company would lead the world in the expansion and refinement of the assembly line concept; and Ford soon brought much of the part production in-house in a vertical integration that seemed a better path for the era. Henry Ford was 39 years old when he founded the Ford Motor Company, which would go on to become one of the world's largest and most profitable companies. As one of the largest family-controlled companies in the world, the Ford Motor Company has been in continuous family control for over 100 years. After the first gasoline powered automobile was created in the year 1885 by German inventor Carl Benz (Benz Patent-Motorwagen), more efficient production methods were needed to make the automobile affordable for the middle-class; which Ford contributed to, for instance by introducing the first moving assembly line in 1913 at its factory in Highland Park. Between 1903 and 1908 Ford produced the Models A, B, C, F, K, N, R, and S, most of which sold in the hundreds or few thousands a year. In 1908 Ford introduced the mass-produced Model T, which would sell in the millions. In 1927, Ford replaced the T with the Model A, the first car with safety glass in the windshield. as a result of high U.S. health care costs for an aging workforce, soaring gasoline prices, eroding market share, and an over dependence on declining SUV sales. Profit margins decreased on large vehicles due to increased ""incentives"" (in the form of rebates or low interest financing) to offset declining demand. Ford announced that it will team up with electricity supply company Southern California Edison (SCE) to examine the future of plug-in hybrids in terms of how home and vehicle energy systems will work with the electrical grid. Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year project, Ford will convert a demonstration fleet of Ford Escape Hybrids into plug-in hybrids, and SCE will evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some of the vehicles will be evaluated ""in typical customer settings"", according to Ford. William Clay Ford Jr., great-grandson of Henry Ford (and better known by his nickname ""Bill""), was appointed Executive Chairman in 1998, and also became Chief Executive Officer of the company in 2001, with the departure of Jacques Nasser, becoming the first member of the Ford family to head the company since the retirement of his uncle, Henry Ford II, in 1982. Ford sold motorsport engineering company Cosworth to Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven in 2004, the start of a decrease in Ford's motorsport involvement. Upon the retirement of President and Chief Operation Officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed his roles as well. Five months later, in September, Ford named Alan Mulally as President and CEO, with Ford continuing as Executive Chairman. In December 2006, the company raised its borrowing capacity to about $25&#160;billion, placing substantially all corporate assets as collateral. Ford and the United Auto Workers, representing approximately 46,000 hourly workers in North America, agreed to a historic contract settlement in November 2007 giving the company a substantial break in terms of its ongoing retiree health care costs and other economic issues. The agreement included the establishment of a company-funded, independently run Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trust to shift the burden of retiree health care from the company's books, thereby improving its balance sheet. This arrangement took effect on January 1, 2010. As a sign of its currently strong cash position, Ford contributed its entire current liability (estimated at approximately US$5.5&#160;billion as of December 31, 2009) to the VEBA in cash, and also pre-paid US$500&#160;million of its future liabilities to the fund. The agreement also gives hourly workers the job security they were seeking by having the company commit to substantial investments in most of its factories. The automaker reported the largest annual loss in company history in 2006 of $12.7&#160;billion, In January 2009, Ford reported a $14.6&#160;billion loss in the preceding year, a record for the company. The company retained sufficient liquidity to fund its operations. Through April 2009, Ford's strategy of debt for equity exchanges erased $9.9 billion in liabilities (28% of its total) in order to leverage its cash position. Logo evolution 1903 1909 1912 1912 variant 1927 2003–Present Corporate affairs Executive management Members of the Ford board as of July 2014 are: Richard A. Gephardt, Stephen Butler, Ellen Marram, Kimberly Casiano, Mark Fields (President and CEO), Edsel Ford II, Homer Neal, William Clay Ford Jr. (Executive Chairman), Anthony F. Earley, Jr., James P. Hackett, John L. Thornton, James H. Hance, Jr., William W. Helman IV, Jon M. Huntsman, Jr., John C. Lechleiter and Gerald L. Shaheen. Ford's realignment also included the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Hertz Rent-a-Car to a private equity group for $15&#160;billion in cash and debt acquisition. The sale was completed on December 22, 2005. A 50–50 joint venture with Mahindra &amp; Mahindra of India, called Mahindra Ford India, Limited (MIFL), ended with Ford buying out Mahindra's remaining stake in the company in 2005. In February 2002, Ford ended car production in the UK. It was the first time in 90 years that Ford cars had not been made in Britain, although production of the Transit van continued at the company's Southampton facility until mid-2013, engines at Bridgend and Dagenham, and transmissions at Halewood. Development of European Ford is broadly split between Dunton in Essex (powertrain, Fiesta/Ka, and commercial vehicles) and Cologne (body, chassis, electrical, Focus, Mondeo) in Germany. Ford also produced the Thames range of commercial vehicles, although the use of this brand name was discontinued circa 1965. Elsewhere in continental Europe, Ford assembles the Mondeo range in Genk (Belgium), Fiesta in Valencia (Spain) and Cologne (Germany), Ka in Valencia (Spain), Focus in Valencia (Spain), Saarlouis (Germany) and Vsevolozhsk (Russia). Transit production is in Kocaeli (Turkey), Southampton (UK), and Transit Connect in Kocaeli (Turkey). Ford also owns a joint-venture production plant in Turkey. Ford Otosan, established in the 1970s, manufactures the Transit Connect compact panel van as well as the ""Jumbo"" and long-wheelbase versions of the full-size Transit. This new production facility was set up near Kocaeli in 2002, and its opening marked the end of Transit assembly in Genk. Another joint venture plant near Setúbal in Portugal, set up in collaboration with Volkswagen, formerly assembled the Galaxy people-carrier as well as its sister ships, the VW Sharan and SEAT Alhambra. With the introduction of the third generation of the Galaxy, Ford has moved the production of the people-carrier to the Genk plant, with Volkswagen taking over sole ownership of the Setúbal facility. In 2008, Ford acquired a majority stake in Automobile Craiova, Romania. Starting 2009, the Ford Transit Connect was Ford's first model produced in Craiova, followed, in 2012, by low-capacity car engines and a new small class car, the B-Max. Oceania Ford FG X Falcon (Australia) The Ford stamping plant in Geelong, Australia In Australia and New Zealand, the popular Ford Falcon has long been considered the average family car and is considerably larger than the Mondeo, Ford's largest car sold in Europe. Between 1960 and 1972, the Falcon was based on a U.S. model of the same name, but since then has been entirely designed and manufactured in Australia, occasionally being manufactured in New Zealand. Like its General Motors rival, the Holden Commodore, the Falcon uses a rear wheel drive layout. High performance variants of the Falcon running locally built engines produce up to 362&#160;hp (270&#160;kW). A ute (short for ""utility"", known in the US as pickup truck) version is also available with the same range of drivetrains. In addition, Ford Australia sells highly tuned limited-production Falcon sedans and utes through its performance car division, Ford Performance Vehicles. In Australia, the Commodore and Falcon have traditionally outsold all other cars and comprise over 20% of the new car market. In New Zealand, Ford was second in market share in the first eight months of 2006 with 14.4%. More recently Ford has axed its Falcon-based LWB variant of its lineup– the Fairlane and LTD ranges, and announced that their Geelong engine manufacturing plant may be shut down from 2013. They have also announced local manufacturing of the Focus small car starting from 2011. In Australia, the Laser was one of Ford Australia's most successful models, and was manufactured in Ford's Homebush plant from 1981 until the plant's closure in September 1994. It outsold the Mazda 323, despite being almost identical to it, because the Laser was manufactured in Australia and Ford was perceived as a local brand. In New Zealand, the Ford Laser and Telstar were assembled alongside the Mazda 323 and 626 until 1997, at the Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ) plant in Wiri, Auckland. The Sierra wagon was also assembled in New Zealand, owing to the popularity of station wagons in that market. The scheduled closure of Ford's Australian manufacturing base in 2016 was confirmed in late May 2013. Headquartered in the Victorian suburb of Broadmeadows, the company had registered losses worth AU$600 million over the five years prior to the announcement. It was noted that the corporate fleet and government sales that account for two-thirds of large, local car sales in Australia are insufficient to keep Ford's products profitable and viable in Australia. The decision will affect 1200 Ford workers—over 600 employees in Geelong and more than 500 in Broadmeadows—who will lose their jobs by October 2016. The factory subsequently produced 10,000 Model A's up to 1936. Production ceased in 1940 as a result of political tensions between Japan and the United States. After World War II, Ford did not have a presence in Japan, as the Ford facility was appropriated by the Japanese Government until 1958, when property was returned as a possession of the Ford Motor Company and became a research and development location for Ford partner Mazda. In 1979, Ford acquired a 24.5% ownership stake in Mazda, and in 1982 Ford and Mazda jointly established a sales channel to sell Ford products in Japan, including vehicles manufactured in North America, at a dealership called Autorama (Japanese). The Autorama sales channel was renamed Ford Sales of Japan in 1997. Vehicles sold at Autorama locations were the North American assembled Ford Explorer, Probe (1989–1998), Mustang, Taurus (1989–1997), Thunderbird (1990–1993), Lincoln Continental, and Lincoln LS. Ford products manufactured in Europe that were sold in Japan were the Ford Mondeo, Ka, Focus, Focus C-MAX, Fiesta, and the Galaxy. Mazda manufactured Ford vehicles in Japan and sold them as Fords at the Autorama locations. They were the Ford Telstar (Mazda Capella), Laser, Festiva, Festiva Mini Wagon, Ixion (Mazda Premacy), Freda (Mazda Bongo Friendee), Spectron (Mazda Bongo), and commercial trucks J80 and the J100 (Mazda Bongo truck). Ford increased its shareholding in Mazda to 33.4% in 1996. Ford currently sells a small range of vehicles in Japan; as of October 2010, the Ford Mustang, Escape, Explorer (and Explorer truck), Ford Kuga, Lincoln Navigator, Lincoln MKX, and more recently the Ford Ecosport are available in Japan. Ford maintains a regional office in Minato, Tokyo, Japan. South and West Asia Ford India began production in 1998 at Chennai, Tamil Nadu, with its Ford Escort model, which was later replaced by the locally produced Ford Ikon in 2001. It has since added the Fusion, Fiesta, Mondeo and Endeavour models to its product line. On March 9, 2010, Ford Motor Co. launched its first made-for-India compact car. Starting at ₹349,900, the Figo was Ford's first car designed and priced for the mass Indian market. On July 28, 2011, Ford India signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the State of Gujarat for the construction of an assembly and engine plant in Sanand, and planned to invest approximately US$1 billion on a 460-acre site. In 2004, Ford sold 30,000 units in the region, falling far short of General Motors' 88,852 units and Nissan Motors' 75,000 units. South America During much of the 20th century, Ford faced protectionist government measures in South America, with the result that it built different models in different countries, without particular regard to rationalization or economy of scale inherent to producing and sharing similar vehicles between the nations. In many cases, new vehicles in a country were based on those of the other manufacturers it had entered into production agreements with, or whose factories it had acquired. For example, the Corcel and Del Rey in Brazil were originally based on Renault vehicles. In 1987, Ford of Brazil and Ford of Argentina merged their operations with the Brazilian and Argentine operations of Volkswagen Group, forming a new joint-venture company called Autolatina with a shared model range. Sales figures and profitability were disappointing, and Autolatina was dissolved in 1995. With the advent of Mercosur, the regional common market, Ford was finally able to rationalize its product line-ups in those countries. Consequently, the Ford Fiesta and Ford EcoSport are only built in Brazil, and the Ford Focus only built in Argentina, with each plant exporting in large volumes to the neighboring countries. Models like the Ford Mondeo from Europe could now be imported completely built up. Ford of Brazil produces a pick-up truck version of the Fiesta, the Courier, which is also produced in South Africa as the Ford Bantam in right hand drive versions. Africa In Africa, Ford's market presence has traditionally been strongest in South Africa and neighbouring countries, with only trucks being sold elsewhere on the continent. Ford in South Africa began by importing kits from Canada to be assembled at its Port Elizabeth facility. Later Ford sourced its models from the UK and Australia, with local versions of the Ford Cortina including the XR6, with a 3.0 V6 engine, and a Cortina-based 'bakkie' or pick-up, which was exported to the UK. In the mid-1980s Ford merged with a rival company, owned by Anglo American, to form the South African Motor Corporation (Samcor). Following international condemnation of apartheid, Ford divested from South Africa in 1988, and sold its stake in Samcor, although it licensed the use of its brand name to the company. Samcor began to assemble Mazdas as well, which affected its product line-up, and saw the European Fords like the Escort and Sierra replaced by the Mazda-based Laser and Telstar. Ford bought a 45 per cent stake in Samcor following the demise of apartheid in 1994, and this later became, once again, a wholly owned subsidiary, the Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa. Ford now sells a local sedan version of the Fiesta (also built in India and Mexico), and the Focus. The Falcon model from Australia was also sold in South Africa, but was dropped in 2003, while the Mondeo, after briefly being assembled locally, was dropped in 2005. The Mondeo has since been reintroduced, but badged as the Fusion. Products and services Automobiles"

It is listed on the NYSE under the ticker BEN, in honor of Benjamin Franklin, for whom the company is named after, and who was admired by founder Rupert Johnson, Sr. In 1973 the company's headquarters moved from New York to San Mateo, California. Today, Franklin Templeton Investments is one of the world's largest asset management groups with over US$850 billion in assets under management (AUM) on behalf of over 25 million private, professional and institutional investors, as at September 30, 2014, up $29.7 billion or 4% during the 4th quarter (FY 2013). Contents 1 History 2 Mutual funds 3 Regulatory issues 4 See also 5 References 6 External links History The company was founded in 1947 in New York by Rupert H. Johnson, Sr., who ran a successful retail brokerage firm from an office on Wall Street. He named the company for American Founding Father Benjamin Franklin because Franklin epitomised the ideas of frugality and prudence when it came to saving and investing. The company's first line of mutual funds, Franklin Custodian Funds, was a series of conservatively managed equity and bond funds designed to appeal to most investors. After Rupert Sr. retired, his son, Charles B. Johnson (Charlie), took over as president and chief executive officer in 1957 at age 24. There were only a handful of employees at that time and the funds had total assets under management of US$2.5 million. Franklin was swimming against the tide because insurance companies dominated the middle class investing markets, but Charlie was convinced that he had a good story to tell. By the early 1960s Charlie and his team's persistence was paying off and the company was growing albeit slowly. It was a struggle to keep up with the day-to-day demands of the business and Charlie continued to wear many hats—mutual fund manager, wholesaler, accountant. Rupert Johnson, Jr., Charlie's brother, joined the company in 1965 and also took on multiple roles. Franklin went public in 1971, which gave Charlie and team the capital needed to grow the business and position it for the future. In 1973, the company acquired Winfield &amp; Company, a San Mateo, California-based investment firm, and moved Franklin's offices from New York to California. The combined organisation had close to US$250 million in assets under management and approximately 60 employees. In 1979, Franklin Money Fund (not available to UK investors) began a growth surge that made it Franklin's first billion-dollar fund and launched the company's tremendous asset growth in the 1980s. Starting in 1980, the company's total assets under management doubled (or nearly doubled) every year for the next six years. The company's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1986 under the ticker symbol ""BEN"". In the same year, the company opened its first office outside North America in Taiwan. In 1988, Franklin acquired L.F. Rothschild Fund Management Company. Assets under management for Franklin grew from just over US$2 billion in 1982 to more than US$40 billion in 1989 (the crash of 1987 had little impact on Franklin's income and bond funds). In October 1992, Franklin acquired Templeton, Galbraith &amp; Hansberger Ltd. for a reported cost of $913 million, leading to the common name Franklin Templeton. Mutual fund pioneer Sir John Templeton was the owner of Templeton, Galbraith &amp; Hansberger Ltd together with his son Dr. John Templeton and John Galbraith who together owned 70% of the firm. Franklin Templeton has over 200 different open-ended mutual funds and 7 closed-end funds in the fund family. Included in these are 36 state and federal tax free income funds, an area of investment pioneered by Franklin. Prominent funds in the fund family include the Templeton Growth Fund, Inc. (opened 1954, $29.5bn assets), the Mutual Shares fund (opened 1949, $7.9bn assets), and the Mutual Discovery Fund (opened 1992, $7.6bn assets) and the Templeton Growth (Euro) Fund A (acc) ($6.1bn assets). The Franklin Income Fund (FKINX, assets $33.6bn) is a mutual fund in Morningstar's ""conservative allocation"" category and ""large/value"" style box. The fund was created in 1948 and has paid uninterrupted dividends for 60 years. The Franklin Income Fund is constructed primarily of dividend-paying stocks and bonds (2%). Regulatory issues"

Officials at Bechtel, the primary project contractor, called mine development at Ertsberg ""the most difficult engineering project they had ever undertaken."" The challenges included building a 101 kilometres (63&#160;mi) long access road (a project that required boring kilometer long tunnels through two mountains) and constructing the world's longest single span aerial tramway. The tramways were needed to move people, supplies and ore because a 2,000 feet (610&#160;m) cliff separates the Ertsberg mine (at 12,000 feet (3,700&#160;m) elevation) from the mill (at 10,000 feet). Moving copper concentrate from that mill to the shipping port required installation of a 109 kilometres (68&#160;mi) slurry pipeline — then the world's longest. Mine construction and startup cost about US$200 million. The Ertsberg project was an engineering marvel, but the mine's early financial performance was disappointing. Depressed copper prices and high operating costs kept profits marginal during the 1970s. In 1981, Freeport Minerals Company merged with the McMoRan Oil and Gas Company. The McMoRan Oil and Gas Company was founded in 1967 by three partners, William Kennon McWilliams Jr. (""Mc""), James Robert (Jim Bob) Moffett (""Mo""), who were both petroleum geologists, and Byron McLean Rankin, Jr. (""Ran""), ""a specialist in land-leasing and sales operations.""  Kent McWilliams (died 1997) was as knowledgeable of the micro-paleontology of the Louisiana and Texas coasts as any geologist of the twentieth century. McMoRan's incredible record in hitting paydirt was based on the fundamental petro-geological learning of the founder and the young geologist he began mentoring in the early 1960s. In 1981, the company formed a 70/30 joint venture with an affiliate of FMC Corporation to operate a gold mine in Jerrit Canyon, Nevada. In 1982, Freeport Gold Company was the world's largest gold producer, producing 196,000 troy ounces (6,100&#160;kg) of gold in its first full year of operation. The Grasberg mine's tailings ""severely impacted"" more than 11 square miles (28&#160;km2) of rainforest, according to a 1996 Dames &amp; Moore environmental audit. The report, endorsed by Freeport, also estimates that during the life of the mine 3.2 billion tons of waste rock—a great part of which generates acid—will be dumped into the local river system. Overburden (waste rock) from the mine has polluted a nearby lake due to acid mine drainage. The Political Economy Research Institute ranks Freeport-McMoRan #41 among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the U.S. The ranking is based on emission quantities (4.5 million pounds in 2013) and toxicity. ^ a b c d e f g h i j Freeport-McMoRan 2015 Form 10-K Annual Report ^ Freeport McMoRan: Morenci Mine ^ Freeport McMoRan: Bagdad Mine ^ Freeport McMoRan: Sierrita Mine ^ Freeport McMoRan: Miami Mine ^ Freeport McMoRan: Safford Mine ^ Freeport McMoRan: Chino Mine ^ Freeport McMoRan: Tyrone Mine ^ Freeport McMoRan: Henderson mine ^ Freeport McMoRan: Climax Mine ^ Atlantic Copper ^ Freeport article, Handbook of Texas ^ a b John Holusha (September 14, 1994).

The Gap's original trademark was a service mark for retail clothing store services. The application was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, 1972 by The Gap Stores; registration was granted on October 10, 1972. The first use of the trademark was on August 23, 1969, and expanded to commercial usage on October 17, 1969. A second application was filed by Gap Stores, Inc. on September 12, 1974, this time for a trademark filed for shirts. The first usage for shirts and clothing products was on June 25, 1974. Trademark registration was granted on December 28, 1976. Both the service mark and trademark are registered and owned by Gap (Apparel), LLC of San Francisco, California. On October 6, 2010, in an effort to establish a contemporary presence, Gap introduced a new logo. It was designed with the Helvetica font and reduced the prominence of the brand's iconic blue box. After much public outcry, the company reverted to its previous ""blue box"" logo on October 12, after less than a week in use. The brand is being criticized in the UK because the merchandise that is offered to the UK customers cost double the prices (or even a direct $/£ swap) found in the United States. Gap also does not offer XXL or larger sizes in the UK stating the UK market does not require them in contrast to market leader NEXT who offer a variety of larger sizes in the UK.

(March 2013) In 2006, Gap took part in the Product Red campaign with the launch of a special RED collection, including a T-shirt manufactured in Lesotho from African cotton. The expanded Gap Product Red collection was released on October 13, 2006. 50 to 100 percent of the profits went to the Global Fund, depending on the item. The company continued the products into 2007, especially in the lead up to Valentine's Day, using slogans such as ""Admi(RED)"" and ""Desi(RED)."" National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights activists criticized Gap's partnerships because Gap has historically been accused of sweatshop-like conditions. Most of these allegations were directed at Wal-Mart (who mostly ignored the claims), while Gap immediately looked into the matter to remedy the situation. Domenico De Sole Doris F.

This company was responsible for developing the U.S. Navy's first submarines built at Lewis Nixon's Crescent Shipyard, located in Elizabethport, New Jersey. The revolutionary submarine boat Holland VI was built there, its keel being laid down in 1896. Crescent's superintendent and naval architect, Arthur Leopold Busch, supervised the construction of this submarine. After being launched on 17 May 1897, it was eventually purchased by the Navy and renamed USS&#160;Holland&#160;(SS-1). The Holland was officially commissioned on 12 October 1900 and became the United States Navy's first submarine, later known as SS-1. The Navy placed an order for more submarines, which were developed in rapid succession and were assembled at two different locations on both coasts. These submarines were known as the A-Class or Adder Class, and became America's first fleet of underwater craft at the beginning of the 20th century. Holland grew short on funds, due to the lengthy and expensive process of introducing the world's first practical submarines, and he had to part with his company and sell his interest to financier Isaac Leopold Rice, renaming the new firm as the Electric Boat Company on 7 February 1899. Holland effectively lost control of the company and found himself earning a salary of $90 a week as chief engineer, while the company that he founded was selling submarines for $300,000 each. excluding the value of the remaining contracts for planes or spare parts. When Electric Boat purchased Canadair, its production line and inventory systems were in disorder. Hopkins hired Canadian-born mass-production specialist H. Oliver West to take over the president's role and return Canadair to profitability. Shortly after the takeover, Canadair began delivering its new Canadair North Star (a version of the Douglas DC-4), and was able to deliver aircraft to Trans-Canada Airlines, Canadian Pacific Airlines, and British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) well in advance of their contracted delivery times. Frank Pace retired under pressure in 1962 and Roger Lewis, former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force and Pan American Airways CEO, was brought in as CEO. The company recovered, then fell back into the same struggles. In 1971, the board brought in McDonnell Douglas president Dave Lewis (no relation) as chairman and CEO, who served until retiring in 1985. Aviation powerhouse During the early 1960s the company bid on the United States Air Force's TFX (Tactical Fighter, Experimental) project for a new low-level ""penetrator"". Robert McNamara, newly installed as the Secretary of Defense, forced a merger of the TFX with U.S. Navy plans for a new long-range ""fleet defender"" aircraft. In order to bid on a naval version successfully, GD partnered with Grumman, who would build a customized version for aircraft carrier duties. After four rounds of bids and changes, the GD/Grumman team finally won the contract over a Boeing submission. The F-111 first flew in December 1964. The F-111B flew in May 1965, but the Navy said that it was too heavy for use on aircraft carriers. In 1972, GD bid on the USAF's Lightweight Fighter (LWF) project. GD and Northrop were awarded prototype contracts. GD's F-111 program was winding down, and the company desperately needed a new aircraft contract. It organized its own version of Lockheed's famed ""Skunk Works"", the Advanced Concepts Laboratory, and responded with a new aircraft design incorporating modern equipment. GD's YF-16 first flew in January 1974, and proved to have slightly better performance than the YF-17 in head-to-head testing. It entered production as the F-16 in January 1975 with an initial order of 650 and a total order of 1,388. The F-16 also won contracts worldwide, beating the F-17 in foreign competition as well. GD built an aircraft production factory in Fort Worth, Texas. F-16 orders eventually totaled more than 4,000, making it the largest and most successful program for the company, and one of the most successful western military projects since World War II. In 1999 the company acquired Gulfstream Aerospace. Here, a Gulfstream G650 departs Bristol Airport, England in 2014. Land Systems focus In 1976, General Dynamics sold the struggling Canadair back to the Canadian government for $38 million. By 1984, General Dynamics had four divisions: Convair in San Diego, General Dynamics-Fort Worth, General Dynamics-Pomona, and General Dynamics-Electronics. In 1985 a further reorganization created the Space Systems Division from the Convair Space division. In 1985, GD also acquired Cessna. In 1986 the Pomona division (which mainly produced the Standard Missile and the Phalanx CIWS for the Navy) was split up, creating the Valley Systems Division. Valley Systems produced the Stinger surface-to-air missile and the Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM). Both units were recombined into one entity in 1992. Henry Crown, still GD's largest shareholder, died on 15 August 1990. Following this, the company started to rapidly divest its under-performing divisions under CEO William Anders. Cessna was re-sold to Textron in January 1992, the San Diego and Pomona missile production units to General Motors-Hughes Aerospace in May 1992, the Fort Worth aircraft production to Lockheed in March 1993 (a nearby electronics production facility was separately sold to Israeli-based Elbit Systems, marking that company's entry into the United States market), and its Space Systems Division to Martin Marietta in 1994. The remaining Convair Aircraft Structure unit was sold to McDonnell Douglas in 1994. The remains of the Convair Division were simply closed in 1996. GD's exit from the aviation world was short-lived, and in 1999 the company acquired Gulfstream Aerospace. The Pomona operation was closed shortly after its sale to Hughes Aircraft. Having divested itself of its aviation holdings, GD concentrated on land and sea products. GD purchased Chrysler's defense divisions in 1982, renaming them General Dynamics Land Systems. In 2003, it purchased the defense divisions of General Motors as well. It is now a major supplier of armored vehicles of all types, including the M1 Abrams, LAV 25, Stryker, and a wide variety of vehicles based on these chassis. General Dynamics Land Systems was hurt by the cancellation of the US Army's Future Combat Systems program and the loss in the MRAP-All Terrain Vehicle competition.

Bruce Flatt, Chairman Sandeep Mathrani, CEO Revenue US $3.02 billion Net income US $994 million General Growth Properties owns or has interest in 120 regional shopping malls in forty states. General Growth Properties has been in the shopping center business for more than 60 years, including such locations as Ala Moana Center (Honolulu), Tysons Galleria (D.C.), Glendale Galleria (Los Angeles) and Water Tower Place (Chicago). The entire GGP portfolio totals roughly 125,000,000 square feet (11,600,000&#160;m2) of retail space and includes more than 24,000 retail stores. These include international retailers and anchors, as well as regional stores covering a range of categories. More than 1.8 billion consumers visit a GGP mall every year. GGP has centers in 37 of the top 50 metro areas in the U.S. More than half of GGP's portfolio is located in these markets including 32 properties in the top 10 U.S. markets. In 1960, General Management opened its second center, Duck Creek Plaza in Bettendorf, Iowa; this was their first mall to have a department store (Younkers) as an anchor. In 1970, General Management became General Growth Properties (GGP). Two years later GGP became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. However, by 1984, management felt that the company's stock price did not fully reflect the value of its business. So management decided to sell the company's assets and take the company private. GGP sold 19 malls to Equitable Real Estate Investment Management in an $800 million deal – considered the largest single real estate transaction in the United States at that time – but continued to manage the malls as part of the deal. Ultimately, shareholders realized a 22% internal rate of return on their investment from the original initial public offering (IPO) through 1984. GGP issued another public offering in 1993 to raise money for future expansion plans. In 1995, GGP moved its headquarters from Des Moines, Iowa, to Chicago. Starting in 1993, GGP expanded its portfolio dramatically by acquiring existing properties and constructing new malls. In 1995, it acquired Homart Development Company, the mall development subsidiary of Sears. GGP reported in excess of $25 billion in debt (mostly mortgages) as of September 30, 2008. In late November 2008, GGP missed a deadline to repay $900 million in loans backed by two Las Vegas retail properties. This meant that GGP lenders could issue a notice of default, which would make GGP seek protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In December 2008 the Wall Street Journal reported that GGP would seek bankruptcy protection if it could not renegotiate its loans. The exit from bankruptcy included the creation of Howard Hughes Corp., as a spinoff, with each holder of a General Growth share was scheduled to receive one share of new General Growth stock and 0.0983 share of Hughes Corp. common stock. Hughes Corp.'s assets will include Summerlin, a 22,500-acre (91&#160;km2) master-planned community in Las Vegas, and South Street Seaport, a shopping center in downtown Manhattan. Unlike General Growth, Hughes Corp. will not be a real estate investment trust, according to a registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission."

Its development of small molecule antiviral therapeutics began in 1991 when CEO Riordan and R&amp;D head John C. Martin in-licensed a group of nucleotide compounds discovered in two European academic labs; one of the compounds was tenofovir, a pro-drug of which, trade named Viread, became one of the most widely used anti-AIDS drugs. In 1990, Gilead entered into a collaborative research agreement with Glaxo for the research and development of genetic code blockers, also known as antisense. This collaboration was terminated in 1998, and Gilead's antisense intellectual property portfolio was sold to Isis Pharmaceuticals. Gilead debuted on the NASDAQ in January 1992. Its initial public offering raised $86.25 million in proceeds. In June 1996, Gilead launched Vistide (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with AIDS. The company cooperated with Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn to market the product outside the United States. In January 1997, Donald Rumsfeld, a Board member since 1988, was appointed Chairman of the company. In March 1999, Gilead acquired NeXstar Pharmaceuticals of Boulder, Colorado following two years of negotiations with the company. At the time, NeXstar's annual sales of $130 million was three times Gilead's sales. NeXstar's two revenue-generating drugs were AmBisome, an injectable fungal treatment, and DaunoXome, an oncology drug taken by HIV patients. Also in 1999, Roche announced first approval of Tamiflu (oseltamivir) for the treatment of influenza. Tamiflu was originally discovered by Gilead and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing. Viread (tenofovir) achieved first approval in 2001 for the treatment of HIV. In January 2003, Gilead completed its acquisition of Triangle Pharmaceuticals. The company also announced its first full year of profitability. Later that year Hepsera (adefovir) was approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, and Emtriva (emtricitabine) for the treatment of HIV. In 2004, Gilead launched Truvada, a fixed-dose combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine. In November 2005, President George W. Bush urged the United States Congress to pass $7.1 billion in emergency funding to prepare for the possible bird flu pandemic, of which $1 billion is solely dedicated to the purchase, and distribution of Tamiflu. In July 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Atripla, a once a day single tablet regimen for HIV, combining Sustiva (efavirenz), a Bristol-Myers Squibb product, and Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil), a Gilead product. Raylo Chemical, based in Edmonton, Alberta, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Degussa AG, a German company. Raylo Chemical was a custom manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients and advanced intermediates for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. In 2009 the company received the award for one of the Fastest Growing Companies by Fortune. In the same year they were also named as one America's Top Companies to work for by Forbes. On July 16, 2012, the U.S. FDA approved the first drug shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection manufactured by Gilead Sciences. The pill Truvada as a preventive measure (PrEP) for people who are at high risk of getting HIV through sexual activity. On July 11, 2014, the Committee of Finance of the United States Senate launched an investigation into the pricing of the hepatitis C drug Sovaldi (sofosbuvir). This was in reaction to the high cost per pill ($1,000), which raised serious questions about the extent to which the market was operating “efficiently and rationally” for this drug. In a letter to CEO John C. Martin, Senators Ron Wyden (Chairman) and Charles E. Grassley (Member) asked Gilead to provide a series of documents to the Committee, and to answer a list of questions, in order for the Committee to get a better understanding of how the company had arrived at the price for this drug. Under an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, Myogen marketed Flolan (epoprostenol sodium) in the United States for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, Myogen was developing (in Phase 3 studies) darusentan, Timetable of Mergers and Acquisitions Year Company Price Notes 1999 NeXstar Pharmaceuticals $550 million NeXstar had two drugs (AmBisome and DaunoXome) of which only AmBisome is still in Gilead's portfolio, although it is not a major source of income for the company. DaunoXome was sold to Diatos in 2006. 2003 Triangle Pharmaceuticals $464 million Triangle owned the development and commercialization rights to emtricitabine, which although marketed as a stand-alone product (Emtriva), is also a component of the more profitable combination products Atripla and Truvada. 2006 Corus Pharma, Inc. $365 million The acquisition of Corus signaled Gilead's entry into the respiratory arena. Corus was developing aztreonam lysine for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis who are infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2006 Myogen, Inc. $2.5 billion With two drugs in development (ambrisentan and darusentan), and one marketed product (Flolan) for pulmonary diseases, the acquisition of Myogen has solidified Gilead's position in this therapeutic arena. 2006 Raylo Chemicals, Inc. $148 million This Edmonton, Alberta site will be used for process research and for manufacturing compounds for both clinical studies and commercial products. 2011 Calistoga Pharmaceuticals $375 million ($225 million additional w/ milestones) Acquisition of Calistoga bolsters areas of oncology and inflammation. 2011 Pharmasset, Inc $10.4 billion This acquisition helps Gilead take the lead in HCV with 7977 (Sofosbuvir). 2013 YM Biosciences, Inc $510 million This acquisition brings drug candidate CYT387, an orally-administered, once-daily, selective inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, specifically JAK1 and JAK2.

Goodyear manufactures tires for automobiles, commercial trucks, light trucks, motorcycles, SUVs, race cars, airplanes, farm equipment and heavy earth-mover machinery. The company was named after American Charles Goodyear, inventor of vulcanized rubber. The first Goodyear tires became popular because they were easily detachable and required little maintenance. The company opened a new global headquarters building in Akron in 2013.

It later manufactured airships and observation balloons for the United States Army Air Service during World War I. The transport and reconnaissance capabilities that Goodyear provided contributed significantly to the Allied victory. In 1916, Litchfield found land in the Phoenix area suitable for growing long-staple cotton, needed for reinforcing rubber in tires. The 36,000 acres purchased were controlled by the Southwest Cotton Company, formed with Litchfield as president. (This included land that would develop into the towns of Goodyear and Litchfield Park.) In 1924, Litchfield, as Goodyear Vice President, forged a joint venture with the German Luftschiffbau Zeppelin Company to form the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation. By 1926 Goodyear was the largest rubber company in the world. Only four years earlier it was forced to temporarily halt production of racing tires due to heavy competition. Nevertheless, the popularity of the Goodyear tire on the racing circuit led to a popular demand for the return of the brand. Expansion 1926–1990 By 1930 Goodyear had pioneered what would later become known as ""tundra tires"" for smaller aircraft — their so-called low inflation pressure ""airwheel"" aviation wheel-rim/tire sets were initially available in sizes up to 46 inches (117&#160;cm) in diameter. On July 10, 2008, Goodyear was recognized as one of America’s most respected companies by the Reputation Institute (RI) and Forbes magazine. Goodyear ranked 16th on the magazine’s third annual listing of companies with the best reputations in the United States. In 2011, more than 70 years after the dissolution of the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation, it is announced that Goodyear will partner with Zeppelin again (the legacy company Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik) to build more zeppelins together. 1898: Goodyear founded 1899: automobile tires added to the original product line of bicycle tires, carriage tires and horseshoe pads 1901: Seiberling makes racing tires for Henry Ford 1903: Paul Litchfield granted patent on first tubeless automobile tire (Litchfield would go on to become president of Goodyear-Zeppelin, then board chairman) 1908: Ford's Model T is outfitted with Goodyear tires 1909: first pneumatic aircraft tire 1911: first airship envelope 1912: Goodyear blimp first debuts 1917: made airships and balloons for the U.S. military during World War I 1919: tires on the winning car at the Indianapolis 500 1924: Zeppelin patents acquired, joint venture Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation formed with the German company 1925: Pilgrim is launched, the first commercial non-rigid airship to use helium 1926: world's largest rubber company, based on sales of $230,161,356 1927: initial public offering  1958: production of foam-padded instrument panels begun for 1959 model cars 1962: Goodyear racing tires used on more winning stock and sports cars than any other brand 1963: Goodyear produces its one billionth tire 1965: radial-ply tires made available in a full range of sizes to auto manufacturers 1967: Goodyear introduces the Polyglas tire, one of the first wide-tread bias-belted fiberglass tires, which along with similar tires from competitors such as the Firestone Wide-Oval would become regular equipment on 1970 to 1974 models, which would be superseded by radial tires beginning in 1975. 1969: sales reach $3 billion 1970: first tires on the moon (Apollo 14) 1974: sales reach $5 billion 1975: all tires used in Indianapolis 500 supplied by Goodyear 1976: Chemical Division shipped first shatterproof polyester resin bottles 1977: industry's first all-season tire (Tiempo) introduced 1978: Akron plant converted into Technical Center for R&amp;D 1983: three billionth tire produced 1984: worldwide sales exceed $10 billion 1986: James Goldsmith takeover attempt and resulting restructuring 1987: completion of the California - Texas ""All American"" oil pipeline 1991: Aquatred tire introduced 1992: began selling tires at Sears stores 1993: opened first tire store in Beijing, China 1993: inauguration of Dalian plant, China 1994: ""electronic store"" opened on CompuServe 1995: worldwide sales exceed $13 billion 1995: Bought Polish Tire Company Dębica, 1998: sold the All American Pipeline and Celeron businesses 1999: Announced $1 billion global alliance with Japan's Sumitomo Rubber Industries, which had rights to the Dunlop tire brand in much of the world, to establish six joint ventures in North America, Europe and Japan 2000: formed an Internet-based purchasing alliance with five other rubber companies called RubberNetwork.com 2003: quarterly dividend to shareholders eliminated 2004: Assurance TripleTred and ComforTred tires introduced 2005: North American farm tire operations sold to Titan Tire Corporation 2006: Goodyear blimp made maiden voyage in China 2007: Engineered Products Division sold to Carlyle Group; EPD is renamed Veyance Technologies 2008: Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association trust (VEBA) approved by U.S. District Court, funded with $1 billion 2009: Goodyear Assurance Fuel Max tire introduced in North America 2010: plans announced to sell European and Latin American farm tire businesses 2011: after being dissolved during WWII, Goodyear and Zeppelin's legacy company partner again to build more airships together Former Board members include James C.

ESG provides technical products and services for petroleum and natural gas exploration and production. Halliburton's former subsidiary, KBR, is a major construction company of refineries, oil fields, pipelines, and chemical plants. Halliburton announced on April 5, 2007 that it had sold the division and severed its corporate relationship with KBR, which had been its contracting, engineering and construction unit as a part of the company.

These businesses continue to be profitable, and the company is one of the world's largest players in these service industries; it is second after Schlumberger, and is followed by Saipem, Weatherford International, and Baker Hughes. With the acquisition of Dresser Industries in 1998, the Kellogg-Brown &amp; Root division (in 2002 renamed to KBR) was formed by merging Halliburton's Brown &amp; Root (acquired 1962) subsidiary and the M.W. Kellogg division of Dresser (which Dresser had merged with in 1988). KBR is a major international construction company that works in an industry that tends to have an element of volatility and is subject to significant fluctuations in revenue and profit. Asbestos-related litigation from Kellogg acquisition caused the company to book more than US$4.0&#160;billion in losses from 2002 through 2004. As a result of the asbestos-related costs and staggering losses on the Barracuda Caratinga FPSO construction project based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Halliburton lost approximately $900&#160;million U.S. a year from 2002 through 2004. A final non-appealable settlement in the asbestos case was reached in January 2005 which allowed Halliburton subsidiary KBR to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy and returned the company to quarterly profitability. While Halliburton's revenues have increased because of its contracts in the Middle East, the overall impact on its bottom line has been mixed. Early history (as HOWCO) Halliburton Research Center in Duncan, Oklahoma, the city which was the original headquarters of Halliburton Company Halliburton (Oak Park) offices in Westchase and in Chinatown in Houston In 1920, he brought a wild gas well under control, using cement, for W.G. Skelly, near Wilson, Oklahoma. By 1922, the Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Company (HOWCO) was prospering from the Mexia, Texas oil boom, having cemented its 500th well in late summer. Halliburton opened a 500,000&#160;sq&#160;ft (46,000&#160;m2) manufacturing center in Duncan, Oklahoma, in 1964. Gearhart Industries (acquired by Halliburton Energy Services in 1989) introduced the first digital computer logging system in 1974. In 1989, Halliburton acquired logging and perforating specialist company Gearhart Industries and combined it with its subsidiary Welex to form Halliburton Logging Services. Throughout the 1980s, Halliburton's subsidiaries continued their projects around the world (under management of former CEO Brian Darcy) even in countries once considered enemies. Equipment was provided for the first multiwell platform offshore China, and an Otis Engineering team controlled a gigantic Tengiz field blowout in the Soviet Union. During the Balkans conflict in the 1990s, Kellogg Brown-Root (KBR) supported U.S. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Hungary with food, laundry, transportation, and other life-cycle management services. 5 Houston Center in Downtown Houston, which at one time housed the headquarters of Halliburton The Wall Street Journal reported in 2001 that a subsidiary of Halliburton Energy Services called Halliburton Products and Services Ltd. (HPS) opened an office in Tehran. The company, HPS, operated on the ninth floor of a new north Tehran tower block. Although HPS was incorporated in the Cayman Islands in 1975 and is ""non-American"", it shares both the logo and name of Halliburton Energy Services and, according to Dow Jones Newswires, offers services from Halliburton units worldwide through its Tehran office. Such behavior, undertaken while Cheney was CEO of Halliburton, may have violated the Trading with the Enemy Act. A Halliburton spokesman, responding to inquiries from Dow Jones, said ""This is not breaking any laws. This is a foreign subsidiary and no U.S. person is involved in this. No U.S. person is facilitating any transaction. We are not performing directly in that country."" Later David Lesar would book his own flights to the Tehran office through the UK arm of KBR. No legal action has been taken against the company or its officials. The contract, referred to as LOGCAP, is a contingency-based contract that is invoked at the convenience of the Army. Because the contract is essentially a retainer, specific orders are not competitively bid (as the overall contract was). In May 2003, Halliburton revealed in SEC filings that its KBR subsidiary had paid a Nigerian official $2.4&#160;million in bribes in order to receive favorable tax treatment., Halliburton opened a new 250,000-square-foot (23,000&#160;m2) facility on 35 acres (140,000&#160;m2), replacing an older facility that opened in 1948, in Rock Springs, Wyoming. With over approximately 500 employees, Halliburton is one of the largest private employers in Sweetwater County. On January 24, 2006, Halliburton's subsidiary KBR (formerly Kellogg, Brown and Root) announced that it had been awarded a $385&#160;million contingency contract by the Department of Homeland Security to build ""temporary detention and processing facilities"" or internment camps. According to Business Wire, this contract will be executed in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District. Critics point to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp as a possible model. According to a press release posted on the Halliburton website, ""The contract, which is effective immediately, provides for establishing temporary detention and processing capabilities to augment existing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) Program facilities in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the U.S., or to support the rapid development of new programs. The contingency support contract provides for planning and, if required, initiation of specific engineering, construction and logistics support tasks to establish, operate and maintain one or more expansion facilities."" It was anticipated that Halliburton's $2.5&#160;billion ""Restore Iraqi Oil"" (RIO) contract Under U.S. law, the government uses single-bid contracts for a number of reasons, to include when in the view of the Government, only one organization is capable of fulfilling the requirement. Bunnatine Greenhouse, a civil servant with 20 years of contracting experience, had complained to Army officials on numerous occasions that Halliburton had been unlawfully receiving special treatment for work in Iraq, Kuwait and the Balkans. Criminal investigations were opened by the U.S. Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Pentagon's inspector general. These investigations found no wrongdoing within the contract award and execution process. In one of Greenhouse's claims, she said that military auditors caught Halliburton overcharging the Pentagon for fuel deliveries into Iraq. She also complained that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's office took control of every aspect of Halliburton's $7&#160;billion Iraqi oil/infrastructure contract. Greenhouse was later demoted for poor performance in her position. In 2002, Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reports were completed to measure the amount of chemicals emitted from Halliburton's Harris County, Texas facility. The TRI is a publicly available EPA database that contains information on toxic chemical releases and waste management activities reported annually by certain industries as well as federal facilities. The facility had 230 TRI air releases in 2001 and 245 in 2002. On March 31, 2003, Management at Halliburton restated earnings downward by $14 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. In the restatement, an additional $3 million expense (net of tax) to continuing operations and an $11 million expense, net of tax, to discontinued operations were recorded.

In addition it planned to consolidate operations at its Westchase and North Belt Campus. The 90 acres (36&#160;ha) North Belt complex will house 2,500 employees. Halliburton planned to add a research and development facility with laboratories, a new cafeteria, a childcare center, two additional parking garages, and fitness and wellness centers for employees. According to Marilyn Bayless, the president of the North Houston Greenspoint Chamber of Commerce, in 2003 Halliburton had planned to move operations out of the North Belt office because other area school districts offered the freeport tax exemptions while the Aldine Independent School District (AISD), where the North Belt office is located, did not. In order to attract businesses, in May 2003, AISD began offering the same tax exemption as other jurisdictions. Subsequently, Halliburton retained the North Belt office."

(H-D), or Harley, is an American motorcycle manufacturer, founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1903. As one of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression (along with Indian), the company has survived numerous ownership arrangements, subsidiary arrangements (e.g., Aermacchi 1974-1978 and Buell 1987-2009), periods of poor economic health and product quality, as well as intense global competition Harley-Davidson traditionally marketed heavyweight, air-cooled cruiser motorcycles with engine displacements greater than 700&#160;cc — and has broadened its offerings to include its more contemporary VRSC (2001) and middle-weight Street (2014) platforms. Harley-Davidson manufactures its motorcycles at factories in York, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Kansas City, Missouri; Manaus, Brazil; and Bawal, India — and markets its products worldwide.

Harley drew up plans for a small engine with a displacement of 7.07 cubic inches (116&#160;cc) and four-inch (102&#160;mm) flywheels. Work immediately began on a new and improved second-generation machine. This first ""real"" Harley-Davidson motorcycle had a bigger engine of 24.74 cubic inches (405&#160;cc) with 9.75 inches (25&#160;cm) flywheels weighing 28&#160;lb (13&#160;kg). The machine's advanced loop-frame pattern was similar to the 1903 Milwaukee Merkel motorcycle (designed by Joseph Merkel, later of Flying Merkel fame). The bigger engine and loop-frame design took it out of the motorized bicycle category and marked the path to future motorcycle designs. The boys also received help with their bigger engine from outboard motor pioneer Ole Evinrude, who was then building gas engines of his own design for automotive use on Milwaukee's Lake Street. Prototype The prototype of the new loop-frame Harley-Davidson was assembled in a 10&#160;ft ×&#160;15&#160;ft (3.0&#160;m ×&#160;4.6&#160;m) shed in the Davidson family backyard. In January 1905, small advertisements were placed in the Automobile and Cycle Trade Journal offering bare Harley-Davidson engines to the do-it-yourself trade. By April, complete motorcycles were in production on a very limited basis. That year, the first Harley-Davidson dealer, Carl H. Lang of Chicago, sold three bikes from the five built in the Davidson backyard shed. Years later the original shed was taken to the Juneau Avenue factory where it would stand for many decades as a tribute to the Motor Company's humble origins until it was accidentally destroyed by contractors cleaning the factory yard in the early 1970s. In 1906, Harley and the Davidson brothers built their first factory on Chestnut Street (later Juneau Avenue), at the current location of Harley-Davidson's corporate headquarters. The first Juneau Avenue plant was a 40&#160;ft ×&#160;60&#160;ft (12&#160;m ×&#160;18&#160;m) single-story wooden structure. The company produced about 50 motorcycles that year. 1907 model. Harley-Davidson 1,000&#160;cc HT 1916 In 1907, William S. Harley graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a degree in mechanical engineering. That year additional factory expansion came with a second floor and later with facings and additions of Milwaukee pale yellow (""cream"") brick. With the new facilities production increased to 150 motorcycles in 1907. The company was officially incorporated that September. They also began selling their motorcycles to police departments around this time, a market that has been important to them ever since. Production in 1905 and 1906 were all single-cylinder models with 26.84 cubic inches (440&#160;cc) engines. In February 1907 a prototype model with a 45-degree V-Twin engine was displayed at the Chicago Automobile Show. Although shown and advertised, very few V-Twin models were built between 1907 and 1910. These first V-Twins displaced 53.68 cubic inches (880&#160;cc) and produced about 7 horsepower (5.2&#160;kW). This gave about double the power of the first singles. Top speed was about 60&#160;mph (100&#160;km/h). Production jumped from 450 motorcycles in 1908 to 1,149 machines in 1909. Harley-Davidson works in 1911 By 1911, some 150 makes of motorcycles had already been built in the United States – although just a handful would survive the 1910s. In 1911, an improved V-Twin model was introduced. The new engine had mechanically operated intake valves, as opposed to the ""automatic"" intake valves used on earlier V-Twins that opened by engine vacuum. With a displacement of 49.48 cubic inches (811&#160;cc), the 1911 V-Twin was smaller than earlier twins, but gave better performance. After 1913 the majority of bikes produced by Harley-Davidson would be V-Twin models. In 1912, Harley-Davidson introduced their patented ""Ful-Floteing Seat"", which was suspended by a coil spring inside the seat tube. The spring tension could be adjusted to suit the rider's weight. More than 3 inches (76&#160;mm) of travel was available. In 1921, a Harley-Davidson, ridden by Otto Walker, was the first motorcycle ever to win a race at an average speed greater than 100&#160;mph (160&#160;km/h). During the 1920s, several improvements were put in place, such as a new 74&#160;cubic inch (1,212.6 &#160;cc) V-Twin, introduced in 1922, and the ""Teardrop"" gas tank in 1925. A front brake was added in 1928 although notably only on the J/JD models. In the late summer of 1929, Harley-Davidson introduced its 45 cubic inches (737&#160;cc) flathead V-Twin to compete with the Indian 101 Scout and the Excelsior Super X. The 2.745&#160;in (69.7&#160;mm) bore and 3.8125&#160;in (96.8&#160;mm) stroke would continue in most versions of the 750 engine; exceptions include the XA and the XR-750. Harley-Davidson UL In the mid-1930s, Alfred Rich Child opened a production line in Japan with the 74-cubic-inch (1,210&#160;cc) VL. The Japanese license-holder, Sankyo Seiyako Corporation, severed its business relations with Harley-Davidson in 1936 and continued manufacturing the VL under the Rikuo name. Harley-Davidson dealer in Texas, ca. 1930-1945 An 80-cubic-inch (1,300&#160;cc) flathead engine was added to the line in 1935, by which time the single-cylinder motorcycles had been discontinued. By 1937, all Harley-Davidson's flathead engines were equipped with dry-sump oil recirculation systems similar to the one introduced in the ""Knucklehead"" OHV engine. The revised 74-cubic-inch (1,210&#160;cc) V and VL models were renamed U and UL, the 80-cubic-inch (1,300&#160;cc) VH and VLH to be renamed UH and ULH, and the 45-cubic-inch (740&#160;cc) R to be renamed W. In 1941, the 74-cubic-inch (1,210&#160;cc) ""Knucklehead"" was introduced as the F and the FL. The 80-cubic-inch (1,300&#160;cc) flathead UH and ULH models were discontinued after 1941, while the 74"" U &amp; UL flathead models were produced up to 1948. Harley-Davidson again produced large numbers of motorcycles for the US Army in World War II and resumed civilian production afterwards, producing a range of large V-twin motorcycles that were successful both on racetracks and for private buyers. Harley-Davidson, on the eve of World War II, was already supplying the Army with a military-specific version of its 45 cubic inches (740&#160;cc) WL line, called the WLA. The A in this case stood for ""Army"". Upon the outbreak of war, the company, along with most other manufacturing enterprises, shifted to war work. More than 90,000 military motorcycles, mostly WLAs and WLCs (the Canadian version) were produced, many to be provided to allies. The WLAs produced during all four years of war production generally have 1942 serial numbers. Production of the WLA stopped at the end of World War II, but was resumed from 1950 to 1952 for use in the Korean War. The U.S. Army also asked Harley-Davidson to produce a new motorcycle with many of the features of BMW's side-valve and shaft-driven R71. Harley largely copied the BMW engine and drive train and produced the shaft-driven 750&#160;cc 1942 Harley-Davidson XA. This shared no dimensions, no parts and no design concepts (except side valves) with any prior Harley-Davidson engine. Due to the superior cooling of the flat-twin engine with the cylinders across the frame, Harley's XA cylinder heads ran 100&#160;°F (56&#160;°C) cooler than its V-twins. Harley-Davidson Hummer"

The company was the parent of Intersil (Harris Semiconductor). Most of the wireless start-ups in South Brevard County were founded and are staffed by former Harris Corporation engineers and technicians. The company's Digital Telephone Systems (DTS) division was sold to Teltronics. In June 2015, Harris acquired Exelis Inc. and subsequently reorganized the company. In 2014, Harris was named one of the top hundred federal contractors by Defense News. In 1979, Harris formed a semiconductor joint venture Matra Harris Semiconductors (MHS), from which Harris withdrew in 1989. After further changes MHS was taken over by Atmel. In November 1998, Harris sold its commercial and standard military logic (semiconductor) product lines to Texas Instruments, which included the HC/HCT, CD4000, AC/ACT, and FCT product families. Harris retained production of the Radiation Hardened versions of these products. In 2005, the corporation spent $870 million on research and development. In January 2011 Harris re-opened its Calgary, Alberta avionics operation, Harris Canada Inc.. The expanded facility's operations include among others the support of the work to be completed under the company's six-year, $273 million (CAD) services contract with the Government of Canada for the CF-18 Avionics Optimized Weapon System Support (OWSS) program. The Harris Electronic Systems segment provides products and services in electronic warfare, avionics, wireless technology, C4I, undersea systems and aerostructures. Electronic Systems (ES) division provides the ""ALQ-214"" radio frequency jamming equipment for the U.S. Navy's F/A-18 Hornet aircraft. The ALQ-214 was originally developed by Exelis ES, which Harris acquired in 2015. Harris Corporation produces multiple cell-site simulator products, such as the StingRay, and Hailstorm phone trackers (see table below); These masquerade as legitimate cellphone towers duping mobile devices to connect to them instead of real cellular networks, so all wireless voice and data traffic originating in a given area are intercepted by the systems, enabling Stingray operators to conduct mass surveillance and triangulate the position of mobile devices. More than six U.S. federal agencies use these platforms, including the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) says at least 53 law enforcement agencies in 21 states, use this or similar devices. Harris have been criticized by civil rights advocates for requiring local municipalities, police and state governments to enter into non-disclosure agreements (NDA) The ACLU, Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) filed two successful civil lawsuits over denied Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and violations of the public records laws of Florida.

It is one of the largest toy makers in the world. The corporate headquarters is located in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. The majority of its products are manufactured in East Asia.

Hassenfeld Brothers expanded to Canada with Hassenfeld Brothers (Canada) Ltd. in 1961. The company was approached in 1963 to license a toy based on The Lieutenant, which they turned down because they did not want to be tied to a possible short-lived television series. Instead, in 1964, Hassenfeld Brothers produced the G.I. Joe toy, which they termed an ""action figure"" in order to market the toy to boys who wouldn't want to play with ""dolls."" In 1964 and 1965, G.I. Joe accounted for two-thirds of Hassenfeld's sales. In 1983, Hasbro purchased GLENCO Infant Items, a manufacturer of infant products and the world's largest bib producer and Knickerbocker Toy Company, a Warner Communications struggling subsidiary. Hasbro paid Warner with 37 percent of its own stock—paid into a Hasbro executive control voting trust—and also received a cash infusion. In 1984, Alan Hassenfeld took over as president from his brother Stephen, who continued as CEO and chairman. That same year, the company (then the nation's sixth-best-selling toymaker) acquired the Milton Bradley Company (then the nation's fifth bestselling toymaker), bringing The Game of Life, Twister, Easy Money and Playskool into the Hasbro fold and transforming Hasbro into Hasbro Bradley. Stephen Hassenfeld became the merged company's president and CEO with Milton Bradley chief James Shea Jr. taking the chairman position. However, the executives clashed and Shea left after a few months, and Stephen and Alan returned to their previous positions. Alan saw the Far East as an important market in which to expand. In 1992, Hasbro purchased Nomura Toys Ltd. in Japan, and majority ownership of Palmyra, a Southeast Asian toy distributor. These increased the proportion of international sales from 22% in 1985 to 45% ($1.28 billion) in 1995. In 1993, Hasbro lost its bid for J. W. Spear &amp; Sons, a U.K.-based game maker, to Mattel. On July 14, 2015, the company announced the intent to sell its last two factories in Ireland and East Longmeadow, Massachusetts factories (including its 360 Manufacturing Services) to Cartamundi which should close in sixty days. Hasbro signed a five-year deal with Cartamundi to produce their board games at the East Longmeadow plant. In 2011, Greenpeace accused Hasbro of purchasing paper for its packaging from ancient forests in Indonesia. Hasbro changed its paper purchasing policy, earning the company praise from Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford, who said: ""The new Hasbro policy will also increase the recycled and Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified paper in its toy packaging. Hasbro's new commitments are great news for Indonesian rainforests and the people and wildlife that depend on them."" Basic Fun Child Guidance Cranium, Inc.

As a result, it has well known and top selling games such as: Main article: List of Hasbro games Axis &amp; Allies Battleship Candy Land Cranium Clue (Cluedo) Diplomacy Duel Masters Trading Card Game Dungeons &amp; Dragons (role-playing game) The Game of Life The Grape Escape Magic: The Gathering (Hasbro's top-selling brand) Mirror-Mirror (Winner of ITV1's ""Design a Board Game Competition"") Monopoly (best selling board game ever according to the Guinness World Records) Ouija Pictionary Risk Scrabble Trivial Pursuit Hasbro also produces many variations of most of their games. For example, in addition to original Scrabble, the game is also available as ""Scrabble Deluxe Edition"", ""Scrabble Deluxe Travel Edition"",""Scrabble Junior"", and ""Scrabble Onyx Edition"". Hasbro also offers games of physical skill such as: Bop It Brain Warp Bull's-Eye Ball Jenga Hasbro also offers a memory game called Simon Swipe. In 1995, Hasbro began a short-lived video game development and publishing venture called Hasbro Interactive, but disbanded it in 2001 when it was bought by the now defunct Infogrames. Now Hasbro develops video games based on its brands through third-party developers and licensing strategies, notably with major American companies such as Activision, Electronic Arts, and THQ. Following the rise of smartphones and tablet PCs in the 2010s, as well as major video gaming publishers cutting back on releasing games based on licensed IPs for various reasons, such as economic slumps, several of Hasbro's brands were licensed towards mobile game developers such as Gameloft, releasing their games under the label Hasbro Gaming. On February 25, 2005, Hasbro announced that it would be introducing a musical toothbrush to the market. The Tooth Tunes, released in early 2007, transmits music from the jawbone to the ear when the bristles touch the teeth. Films and television Further information: Hasbro Studios"

Hess_Corporation," Hess Corporation Type Public company Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;HES S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Oil and Gas Founded 1919 Headquarters Corporate Headquarters: 1185 Avenue of the Americas New York, New York Exploration and Production: 1501 McKinney Street Houston, Texas Marketing and Refining: Woodbridge, New Jersey Products Petrochemical Revenue $22.2 billion (2013) Net income $5.1 billion (2013) Number of employees 6,045 Website www.hess.com The Hess Corporation (formerly Amerada Hess) is an American integrated oil company headquartered in New York City, and a Fortune 100 corporation. The company explores, produces, transports, and refines crude oil and natural gas. Refined petroleum products, as well as natural gas and electricity, are marketed to customers throughout the East Coast of the United States. Although towered over in size by enormous global players in the same industry, Hess placed #75 in the 2013 Fortune 500 rankings. In 2014, Hess sold its gas station network to Marathon Petroleum in order to focus on exploration and production, reducing its headcount from 12,225 employees to 6,045 employees. By 2015, they were all converted to the Marathon-owned Speedway brand. The company has exploration and production operations in the United States, United Kingdom, Norway, Denmark, Russia, Equatorial Guinea, Algeria, Libya, Gabon, Egypt, Ghana, the Joint Development Area of Malaysia and Thailand, Indonesia, Thailand, Azerbaijan, Australia, Brazil, and St. Lucia. Hess is also active in the financial markets, through the Hess Energy Trading Company (HETCO), its trading arm. Contents 1 History 2 Hess Energy Trading Company 3 Environmental record 4 Locations 5 Toy trucks 5.1 Models 5.2 Miniature trucks 6 References 7 External links History there is no link between the rise in gas prices after the announcement of the closing of the Woodbridge (Port Reading) NJ facility. The output of that facility was more geared to the aviation and specialty fuels markets and not automotive grade products On March 4, 2013 Hess announced that it would sell its domestic refineries and retail operations and that it would also sell its holdings in Indonesia and Thailand. The New York Times also reported that Hess retail and refinery operations contributed about 4 percent of the company's revenue. It also noted that Hess will sell its holdings in Indonesia and Thailand. Hess Energy Trading Company (HETCO) is a full-service proprietary energy trading company and market maker established in 1997. HETCO offers its clients and partners extensive access to the global physical and financial energy markets. HETCO is partly owned by, and fully guaranteed by Hess Corporation, a Fortune 100 company. HETCO is an advisor and risk management counterparty of some of the largest energy enterprises in the world. As a major player in all energy markets (cash, futures and options, physical and cash-settled), HETCO is responsible for a significant market share of the Electricity, Natural Gas, Weather, Crude Oil, Refined products and energy equity derivatives. Hess has gross exposure to oil derivatives equivalent to 1.7bn barrels – about three months’ US consumption – from trading “conducted principally” through HETCO, filings show. HETCO also offers specialist energy advisory services to public, private, state-owned companies, sovereign entities and financial institutions through its subsidiary HETCO Advisory Services (UK) Ltd. One of HETCO’s coups came in 2004 when the company signed a contract to help Sonatrach, the Algerian oil and gas company, hedge price risks and expand its customer list to the US and the Asia-Pacific regions. The New York Times reported on October 28, 1990, that a barge, with a load of 31,000 barrels (4,900&#160;m3) of kerosene, struck a reef in the Hudson River spilling 163,000 US gallons (620&#160;m3) of fuel. Immediately, Hess assumed responsibility for the cleanup; the Coast Guard worked alongside the Red Star company to clean and to contain the spill to one area. Coast Guard official Mr. Holmes said ""The weather and wind conditions are almost as close to perfect as they could get,"" and this contributed to a quicker and surer cleanup than could otherwise be. According to The New York Times, Mr. Holmes also said that 70 percent of the spill would be gone in three days due to the natural evaporation rate of kerosene. Even though most kerosene evaporates, toxic chemicals such as benzene stay in the water and harm certain fish. Hess claims that their corporate policy has ""long stressed"" their ""fundamental commitment to comply with applicable environment, health and safety laws and regulations,"" and they claim to clean every spill made. The Patchogue Oil Company, brought under the Amerada Hess Company in 1977, was responsible for an oil spill in the Gowanus Canal on January 3, 1976, when more than 2.5&#160;million US gallons (9,500&#160;m3) of number 6 crude oil was spilled into the Gowanus Canal. At that time, this was the largest oil spill on record. In accordance with a New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) agreement the Hess Corporation will pay $1.1 million in fines and also ""bring 65 gasoline stations and oil storage facilities into compliance with state requirements."" The agreement addresses more than 100 violations at 65 gas stations and Hess's Brooklyn major oil storage facility. The agreement is aimed at resolving Hess's violations in the DEC's New York City and lower Hudson Valley regions. In a recent water contamination case against several major US oil companies, the Hess Corporation will pay part of a $422 million settlement. The case was filed by 153 public water providers in 17 states against the oil companies ""over drinking water contamination caused by the gasoline additive Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE)."" The settlement also stipulates that the settling parties pay their share of treatment costs of the plaintiff's wells that may become contaminated or require treatment for the next 30 years. ^ a b Matt Krantz (March 13, 2015).

More Doing. Website www.homedepot.com The Home Depot (referred to in some countries and often in colloquial speech simply as Home Depot) is an American retailer of home improvement and construction products and services. It operates many big-box format stores across the United States (including all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands and Guam), all ten provinces of Canada, as well as Mexico. The company is headquartered at the Atlanta Store Support Center in Cobb County, Georgia, in Greater Atlanta. In terms of overall revenue reported to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company is the largest home improvement retailer in the United States, ahead of rival Lowe's. The store operates out of large warehouse-style buildings averaging 105,000&#160;ft2 (9,755 m2) with megastores operating in larger facilities (the company's largest store, located in Union, New Jersey is 225,000&#160;ft2). ” — Arthur Blank In 1979, the first two stores, built in spaces leased from J. C. Penney that were originally Treasure Island ""hypermarket"" (discount department and grocery) stores, opened in metro Atlanta (in Doraville and on Memorial Drive in Decatur, both near I-285) The first headquarters was on Terrell Mill Road on the southeast side of Marietta, Georgia, just down from one of the stores at the corner of Cobb Parkway. (That store 33°54′23″N 84°29′14″W﻿ / ﻿33.9065°N 84.4872°W﻿ / 33.9065; -84.4872﻿ (former location of The Home Depot's first flagship store (Marietta Plaza, 1979)), in the Marietta Plaza strip mall, became Value City, changing to Burlington Coat Factory in 2008; part was also a short-lived Little Bucks, in which Brill had a stake.) Since the 1990s, its headquarters (33°51′54″N 84°28′55″W﻿ / ﻿33.865°N 84.482°W﻿ / 33.865; -84.482﻿ (The Home Depot, headquarters)) have been a complex of high-rise buildings on Paces Ferry Road, on the western edge of the Cumberland/Galleria edge city in unincorporated Cobb County, Georgia, across Interstate 285 from the town of Vinings, and served by mail from Atlanta. The tallest building is approximately 85 metres (279&#160;ft) high, the fourth-tallest in the Vinings area. Nardelli, who regarded home improvement store-by-store sales as less important due to market saturation from competition such as Lowe's, aimed to dominate the wholesale housing-supply business through building up HD Supply, a unit that Blake sold for $8.5 billion in August 2007 since it was not part of Home Depot's integrated business. In comparison to Nardelli, whose numbers-driven approach never appreciated the role of the store and its associates, Blake's strategy has revolved around reinvigorating the stores and its service culture (engaging employees, making products readily available and exciting to customers, improving the store environment, and dominating the professional contracting business, an area in which Home Depot's closest rivals trail far behind), as he recognized that employee morale is a more sensitive issue in retail compared to other industry sectors like manufacturing. Its 2005 sales totaled US$91.8 billion (US$77.0 billion in retail sales). Despite the 10% increase in revenue, it dropped three spots to No. 17 on the 2007 FORTUNE magazine's FORTUNE 500 list (it was No. 13 in 2005 and No. 14 in 2006). The Home Depot owned EXPO Design Center, a chain of home decorating and appliance stores, but closed the chain in 2009. In 2001, it acquired distributor Your Other Warehouse (YOW), which still operates as its own division. In 2006, the Home Depot acquired Hughes Supply which was assimilated into HD Supply serving contractors, which it sold in June 2007. In September 2005, Home Depot Direct launched its online home-furnishings store, 10 Crescent Lane, shortly followed by the launch of Paces Trading Company, its online lighting store. In mid 2006, the Home Depot acquired Home Decorators Collection, which was placed as an additional brand under its Home Depot Direct division. Home Depot Landscape Supply, with only a few stores each in metro Atlanta and Dallas/Fort Worth, was founded in 2002 and closed in late 2007. On January 2, 2007, the Home Depot and Robert Nardelli mutually agreed on Nardelli's resignation as CEO after a six-year tenure. Nardelli resigned amid complaints over his heavy-handed management and whether his pay package of $123.7 million (excluding stock option grants) over the previous five years was excessive, considering the stock's poor performance versus its competitor Lowe's. His severance package of $210 million was criticized because when the stock went down his pay went up. In 2007, the Home Depot sold its $13 billion revenue wholesale (trade) division, HD Supply, to a consortium of three private equity firms, The Carlyle Group, Bain Capital and Clayton, Dubilier and Rice (with each agreeing to buy a one-third stake in the division). Home Depot sold their wholesale construction supply business to fund a stock repurchase estimated at $40 billion. Map of Home Depot stores in the contiguous United States and Southern Canada, as of August 2011. The Home Depot in Durham, North Carolina in October 2008. Employees at a Home Depot Superstore in Union, New Jersey in January 2013. Home Depot stores average 105,000&#160;ft2 (9,755 m2) in size and are organized warehouse-style, stocking a large range of supplies. Home Depot's two largest stores are located in Union, New Jersey, which encompasses 217,000&#160;ft2 of space, and in Anaheim Hills, California where it encompasses 204,000&#160;ft2. The company color is a bright orange (PMS 165, CMYK 60M100Y, HEX FF6600), on signs, equipment and employee aprons. It was announced in August 2014 that Craig Menear will take over for Frank Blake as CEO while Blake will remain the chairman of the board. The Home Depot exclusively carries several major brands, including: Chem-Dry (carpet cleaning, upholstery cleaning, tile and grout services) GAF Materials Corporation Behr paints Rheem (water heaters) Homelite (outdoor and power tools) Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (outdoor furniture, indoor organization) Ryobi and Ridgid (power tools) American Woodmark cabinetry Thomasville Furniture Industries cabinetry Additionally, the retailer has its own house brands: Husky (tools) Workforce (tools, shelving, storage cabinets, extension cords, worklights, tarps, paintbrushes) HDX Glacier Bay (kitchen sinks, faucets, etc.) Commercial Electric Home Decorators Collection Hampton Bay (ceiling fans, lighting, outdoor furnishings, and outdoor shelters) Fuel centers Starting in 2006, the Home Depot has started testing with fuel centers at some of its stores. The first such ""Home Depot Fuel"" convenience store (C-Store) was located in Brentwood, Tennessee followed a month later by a center about 20 miles (32&#160;km) away in Hermitage, both suburbs of Nashville. Four additional prototype stores were built within the year at Acworth, Georgia; Smyrna, Tennessee; Greensboro, Georgia; and then Winchester, Tennessee in that order. The centers are expected to earn $5–$7 million per year, though the actual number is reported to be much higher. The fuel centers sell beer, hot food, snacks along with providing diesel fuel and gas at a separate island. This allows contractors with large trucks to be able to fill their vehicles. The fuel centers offer car washes, which are large enough to accommodate full-size pickup trucks and other large commercial vehicles. Home Depot has since worked with environmental groups to create a variety of green programs. For example, Home Depot planted thousands of trees at its headquarters in Atlanta to offset carbon emissions. In 2007, The Home Depot Foundation (the company's charitable foundation) committed to investing $100 million over the next decade to build over 100,000 green affordable homes and plant 3,000,000 trees. Additionally, The Home Depot promotes compact fluorescent light bulbs in their stores. As part of this effort, the company has created the largest recycling program in the United States for the bulbs. The Home Depot was the title sponsor of The Home Depot Center in Carson, California, home to both the Los Angeles Galaxy and Chivas USA of Major League Soccer, and Los Angeles Riptide (Major League Lacrosse), and many past major sporting events. The venue is now called StubHub Center. In 2006, The Home Depot partnered with Duke University's Edmund T. Pratt Jr. School of Engineering to create ""The Home Depot Smart Home"". The smart home is a live-in laboratory for ten upper-class engineering students that allows them to immerse themselves in the work. The goal of the project is to help provide innovative solutions for the home in areas such as security and home monitoring, communications, energy efficiency, entertainment, environment and health. Home Depot Canada is the Canadian unit of the Home Depot and one of Canada's top home improvement retailers. The Canadian operation consists of 180 stores and employs over 28,000 people in Canada. Home Depot Canada has stores in all ten Canadian provinces and serves territorial Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and Yukon through electronic means (Online Sales). The Canadian head office is located in Toronto. The Canadian unit was created with the purchase of Aikenhead's Hardware. Home Depot management has an ambitious plan to overtake its biggest competitor, RONA, which has about four times as many stores. However, some of RONA's stores are smaller than the typical Home Depot store. In terms of big box stores, the Home Depot has more stores than RONA, (not including other Rona banners such as Réno Dépôt or Cashway). As of 2007, RONA pulled ahead of The Home Depot in total retail sales, due to aggressive consolidation efforts by RONA, combined with the loss of The Home Depot's industrial supply division, HD Supply, in July 2007. The Home Depot now faces competition from Lowe's as they have moved into the Canadian market effective the end of 2007; Lowe's now has 35 outlets in Canada. The Home Depot banner in Quebec, where it has 22 stores, reads ""Home Depot"" without the definite article ""the"" in order to ensure a more cross-compatible proper name (that does not read like an English sentence) between both the French and English languages. However, Home Depot is still in English and not in French, which would be Entrepôt de la maison. Mexico The Home Depot was embroiled in whistleblower litigation brought under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) law. In July 2005, former employee Michael Davis, represented by attorney Mark D. Schwartz filed a whistleblower lawsuit against the Home Depot, alleging that his discharge was in retaliation for refusing to make unwarranted backcharges against vendors. Davis alleges that the Home Depot forced its employees to meet a set quota of backcharges to cover damaged or defective merchandise, forcing employees to make chargebacks to vendors for merchandise that was undamaged and not defective. The Home Depot alleges that it fired Davis for repeatedly failing to show up for work. The trial initially was concluded in June 2006, but in April 2007, U.S. Department of Labor Judge Pamela Lakes Wood ordered the case reopened after the Home Depot's law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld revealed that the retail giant's in-house counsel had told them that two Home Depot employees who testified at the trial had lied. Akin Gump sent Wood a letter on September 29, 2006, in which the law firm requested that the testimony be stricken. In response to Akin Gump's revelation, Davis' attorney Mark D. Schwartz asked for the case to be reopened to permit further questioning of the witnesses. On April 6, 2007, Wood ordered the case to be reopened. Schwartz was quoted by the New York Post as saying, ""I have reason to believe these witnesses were intimidated into giving false testimony."" The Home Depot called Schwartz's allegations ""meritless"". Powell v. Home Depot USA, Inc. (2008cv61862) (2011) was a decision by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida concerning patent infringement on a “safe hands” device that Michael Powell, an independent contractor for Home Depot, created in response to injuries to the hands of associates using in-store radial arm saws. The District Court jury returned a verdict in favor of Powell. In 2011, Home Depot appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, challenging the district court’s denial of its renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issues of infringement, willfulness, and damages. In the wake of the 2011 Joplin tornado in which the walls of a Home Depot collapsed in Joplin after being hit by an EF5 tornado, The Kansas City Star citing engineers criticized Home Depot's practice of using tilt up construction in hundreds of its big box stores (other nearby big box stores in Joplin including a Walmart and Academy Sports which had a different concrete block construction lost their roofs but the walls remained intact). In tilt up construction the concrete is poured on site and lifted into place and then attached to the roof. The engineers told the Star that the practice while normally safe and efficient is dangerous in major storms because once the roof is lifted (as happened in Joplin) the walls collapse in a domino effect. Seven people were killed in the front of the store when the 100,000 pound walls collapsed on them while 28 people in the back of the store survived when those walls collapsed outward. Only two of the slab walls in the Home Depot survived. In contrast 3 people died in the Walmart but 200 survived. Engineers noted that when concrete blocks construction fail, it breaks in pieces and usually not in huge slabs. Home Depot said it fundamentally disagreed with the Star engineers and said it would use tilt up construction when it rebuilds the Joplin store."

The company operates three business units, known as a Strategic Business Unit–Aerospace, Automation and Control Solutions (ACS), and Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT). The company and its corporate predecessors were part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index from December 7, 1925 until February 9, 2008. The company's current name, Honeywell International Inc., is the product of a merger in which Honeywell Inc. was acquired by the much larger AlliedSignal in 1999. The company headquarters were consolidated with AlliedSignal's headquarters in Morristown, New Jersey; however the combined company chose the name ""Honeywell"" because of its superior brand recognition. Honeywell has many brands that commercial and retail consumers may recognize, including its line of home thermostats (particularly the iconic round type) and Garrett turbochargers. In addition to consumer home products Honeywell itself produces such as thermostats, sensors, security alarm systems, and air cleaners and dehumidifiers, the company also licenses its brand name for use in various retail products made by partner manufacturers such as air conditioners, heaters, fans, security safes, home generators, and paper shredders.

In 1906, Mark Honeywell founded the Honeywell Heating Specialty Company in Wabash, Indiana to manufacture and market his invention, the mercury seal generator. As Honeywell’s company grew (thanks in part to the acquisition of Jewell Manufacturing Company in 1922 to better automate his heating system) it began to clash with the renamed Minneapolis Heat Regulator Company. This led to the merging of the two companies into the publicly held Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Company in 1927. Honeywell named its first president, W.R. Sweatt as its first chairman.:118 Two years later in 1957, their first computer, the D-1000, was sold and installed. In 1960, just five years after embarking on this venture with Raytheon, Minneapolis-Honeywell bought out Raytheon’s interest in Datamatic and turned it into the Electronic Data Processing division (now Honeywell Information Systems) of Minneapolis-Honeywell.:118 Honeywell also purchased minicomputer pioneer Computer Control Corporation (3C's), renaming it as Honeywell's Computer Control Division. Through most of the 1960s, Honeywell was one of the ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" of computing. IBM was ""Snow White"", while the dwarfs were the seven significantly smaller computer companies: Burroughs, Control Data Corporation, General Electric, Honeywell, NCR, RCA, and UNIVAC. Later, when their number had been reduced to five,:122 With the acquisition, Honeywell took over responsibility for GE's ongoing Multics operating system project. The design and features of Multics greatly influenced the Unix operating system. Multics also influenced many of the features of Honeywell/GE's GECOS and GCOS8 General Comprehensive Operating System operating systems. Honeywell, Groupe Bull, and Control Data Corporation formed a joint venture in Magnetic Peripherals Inc. which became a major player in the hard disk drive market. It was the worldwide leader in 14-inch disk drive technology in the OEM marketplace in the 1970s and early 1980s especially with its SMD (Storage Module Drive) and CMD (Cartridge Module Drive). In the second half of the 1970s, Honeywell started to look to international markets again, acquiring the French Compagnie Internationale pour l’Informatique in 1976. In October of 2000, Honeywell (then valued at over $21 billion) accepted a takeover bid from then-CEO Jack Welch of General Electric. This decision was taken on the grounds that with GE's dominance of the large jet engine market (led by the General Electric CF34 turbofan engine), its leasing services (GECAS), and Honeywell's portfolio of regional jet engines and avionics, the new company would be able to ""bundle"" products and stifle competition through the creation of a horizontal monopoly. US regulators disagreed, finding that the merger would improve competition and reduce prices; United States Assistant Attorney General Charles James called the EU's decision ""antithetical to the goals of antitrust law enforcement."" The current ""Honeywell International Inc."" is the product of a merger between AlliedSignal and Honeywell Inc. Although AlliedSignal was twice the size of Honeywell, the combined company chose the name ""Honeywell"" because of its superior brand recognition. However, the corporate headquarters were consolidated to AlliedSignal's headquarters in Morristown, New Jersey rather than Honeywell's former headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota. When Honeywell closed its corporate headquarters in Minneapolis, over one thousand employees lost their jobs. A few moved to Morristown or other company locations, but the majority were forced to find new jobs or retire. Soon after the merger, the company's stock fell significantly, and did not return to its pre-merger level until 2007. In January 2002 Knorr-Bremse&#160;– who had been operating in a joint venture with Honeywell International Inc.&#160;– assumed full ownership of its ventures in Europe, Brazil, and the USA. Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems became a subsidiary of Knorr-Bremse AG. Although declining in influence, Honeywell maintains a presence in emerging industries, such as Northern Alberta's oil sands. Honeywell's Plant integrator is currently deployed in some of the most important plant-sites in the Oil Sands (Syncrude, Suncor, and others). In February 2002, Honeywell’s board appointed their current CEO and Chairman, David M. Cote. Cote has been instrumental in uniting the company cultures of Honeywell, AlliedSignal, and Pittway. Since 2002, Honeywell has made more than 80 acquisitions and 60 divestures, while adding $12 billion in new sales In December 2004, Honeywell made a £1.2bn ($2.3bn) bid for Novar plc. In October 2015, Honeywell moved its international headquarters from Morristown to Morris Plains, in the Morris Township in New Jersey.The 475,000-square-foot building on 40 acres in Morris Plains features state-of-the-art technology and greater energy efficiency than Honeywell’s Morristown campus, which was underutilized, outdated and costly, according to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dave Cote. On December 29th 2015 Honeywell completed the sale of Elster for US$ 5.1B (announced on July 28th 2015) entering the space of gas electricity and water meters with a specific focus on smart meters and hoped to be a growth driver for Honeywell in 2016 and beyond. The deal also complements the HON Combustion business with the addition of Elster with strong brands such as Kromschroeder and Eclipse. In January 2016, Honeywell International Inc. acquired the 30% stake in UOP Russell LLC it didn't own already for roughly $240 million. Honeywell International is divided into four Strategic Business Groups (SBG): Honeywell Aerospace, Honeywell Automation and Control Solutions, and Honeywell Performance Materials and Technologies. Within SBGs are Strategic Business Units (SBU). The Honeywell Commercial Aviation business unit creates products for large commercial and regional aircraft such as auxiliary power units (APUs), aircraft environmental control systems, electric power systems, engine system accessories, flight data and cockpit voice recorders, air traffic management solutions, radar, navigation and communications systems, aircraft lighting, wheels and brakes. Honeywell ACS business group’s 400+ products are from its seven major product groups: environmental and combustion controls; sensing controls, security and life safety products and services, scanning and mobility, and building solutions and services. Honeywell ACS manufactures automated systems for temperature and humidity, surveillance and security detection, and lighting. Instrumentation products include actuators, controllers, and related software. Additional products include thermostats, security systems (ADEMCO brand), water filters, scanners, remote patient monitoring, protective clothing, and central control systems. Products in Honeywell Scanning &amp; Mobility (HSM) include mobile computers and bar code scanners, radio frequency identification solutions, voice-enabled workflow and printing solutions. In 2013, Honeywell completed the acquisition of Intermec, which included the Vocollect and Enterprise Mobile brands, and integrated them into Honeywell Scanning &amp; Mobility. Honeywell Sensing and Control (Honeywell S&amp;C) produces over 50,000 products ranging from snap action, limit, toggle and pressure switches to position, speed and airflow sensors.

(October 2015) 19th century The building in which George A. Hormel started his business. Preserved at the Mower County Fairgrounds in Austin. George A. Hormel (born 1860 in Buffalo, New York) worked in a Chicago slaughterhouse before becoming a traveling wool and hide buyer. His travels took him to Austin and he decided to settle there, borrow $500, and open a meat business. Hormel handled the production side of the business and his partner, Albert Friedrich, handled the retail side. The two dissolved their partnership in 1891 so that Hormel could start a complete meat packing operation on his own. In the late 1920s and early 1930s sales branches opened up in Houston, Beaumont, Chattanooga, New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Newark, Los Angeles, Vicksburg, and Nuevo Laredo (Mexico). By the late-1930s, full-page, four color ads were routinely appearing in the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies Home Journal and Woman's Home Companion. Hormel ads also were featured on the radio program The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show. In 1933, workers, led by itinerant butcher Frank Ellis, formed the Independent Union of All Workers and conducted one of the nation's first successful sit-down strikes; the union would later join the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO, later AFL-CIO). Play media This Is Hormel (1964) hot dog segment Little Sizzlers sausages were introduced in 1961 In 1962, Hormel constructed a 75,000-square-foot (7,000&#160;m2) sausage manufacturing building in Austin and discontinued the slaughter of calves and lambs. During Thompson's tenure (1965–1969) a dry sausage plant was built in Algona and distribution centers were built in San Antonio, New Orleans and Atlanta. In 1967, the company, in cooperation with the National Merit Scholarship Program, started a college scholarship program for the children of Hormel employees. Partial scholarships were awarded through this program on the basis of the student's test scores, academic records, financial need, and school and community involvement. A separate building to house the growing research and development department was built northwest of the corporate office in Austin in 1968. In 1969, Gray resigned from the company and Thompson replaced him as chairman (by this time the chairman was called the CEO) and I.J. Holton was named president. That same year the company introduced its Matching Gifts program in which it offered to match the donation (up to $2,000) made by any employee to any accredited college or university. In 1972, Holton became CEO and distribution centers were opened in Orlando and Shreveport and a food service facility was built in Oklahoma City. A grocery products plant was opened in Beloit in 1973. The new Austin plant, a 1,300,000-square-foot (120,000&#160;m2) facility, began production on May 24, 1982, and was dedicated on September 12, 1982. It became one of the longest strikes of the 1980s. The strike began with the sanction of the Local of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, P-9. The local chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union P-9 led the strike, but was not supported by their parent union. The strike gained national attention and led to a widely publicized boycott of Hormel products. After six months, a significant number of strikebreakers crossed the picket line, provoking riots in Austin. On January 21, 1986, the Governor of Minnesota, Rudy Perpich, called in the National Guard to protect the strikebreakers. This brought protests against the governor, and the National Guard withdrew from Austin. The action had a greater effect on the UFCW international, which ousted the local P-9. The strike ended in June 1986, after lasting 10 months. Over 700 of the workers did not return to their jobs, refusing to cross the picket line. In solidarity with those workers, the boycott of Hormel products continued for some time. Ultimately, however, the company did succeed in hiring new workers at significantly lower wages. The strike was chronicled in the film American Dream, which won the Academy Award for best documentary in 1990. A song about the strike, entitled ""P-9"" was written by Dave Pirner of the Minneapolis band Soul Asylum. The song can be found on their 1989 album, Clam Dip &amp; Other Delights. The strike has also had a Harvard Business School Case written based on it (with assumed names), called ""Adam Baxter Co./Local 190"" which features multiple rounds of negotiations between unions and management. Recent acquisitions by Hormel Foods include: Diamond Crystal Brands (2002), Century Foods International (2003) Clougherty Packing (Farmer John) (2004), Lloyd’s Barbeque Company (2005), Mark-Lynn Foods (2005), Arriba Foods (2005), Provena Foods (2006) and Burke Foods (2007). The company has been included on the Corporate Responsibility (CR) Magazine 100 Best Corporate Citizens List for the last seven consecutive years. In 2015, SPAMMY® became available for purchase under Title I for U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) feeding programs and Title II for U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) programs under the name fortified poultry-based spread (FPBS)."

Marriott (Chairman) W. Edward Walter (President and CEO) Products REIT—Lodging Revenue US$ 5.35 billion (2014) Net income US$ 747 million (2014) Total assets US$ 12.2 billion (2014) Number of employees 251 Website www.hosthotels.com Host Hotels &amp; Resorts (NYSE:&#160;HST) is an American real estate investment trust and the owner of lodging real estate based in Bethesda, Maryland. History Host Hotels &amp; Resorts was formed in 1993 when the Marriott Corporation split into two separate entities, creating Marriott International and Host Marriott. Marriott International represented the original Marriott company prior to Marriott's 1982 acquisition of the old Host International Company, founded in 1897 as the Van Noy Railway News and Hotel Company by the Van Noy Brothers of Kansas City, MO. After the spin-off, the original assets and services comprising the Host International acquisition, encompassing the ownership of lodging real estate and operators of airport terminal concession businesses and franchises, were consolidated as the Host Marriott Corporation. On January 2, 1996, Host Marriott further divided into two separate companies. Host Marriott continues to own lodging real estate. A new company, Host Marriott Services Corporation (now known as HMSHost Corporation) was created to hold and operate concessions at airports, on toll roads, and at sports and entertainment attractions. On April 4, 1996, Host Marriott sold 18 Residence Inns and 16 Marriott Courtyard Hotels to Hospitality Properties Trust to focus on other areas of the business. On June 21, 1997, Host Marriott acquired Forum Group, Inc. and its retirement communities, Marriott Senior Living Services. In December 1998, Crestline Capital Corporation was spun off to allow Host Marriott to complete an announced conversion to a REIT. As part of the spinoff, Host Marriott arranged to lease back much of the property that was being spun off. At the end of the year, the preparations were completed with Host Marriott emerging as a REIT on January 1, 1999. In November 2005, Host Marriott announced that it would purchase 38 domestic and international hotel properties for approximately $4.1 billion. The seller was Starwood Hotels &amp; Resorts, a hotel owner/operator based in White Plains, New York. Starwood would continue to manage the portfolio of 20 Sheratons, 13 Westins, two W's, one St Regis, one Luxury Collection hotel, one nonbranded property. As part of the transaction, Host Marriott was renamed Host Hotels &amp; Resorts to better reflect its more diversified portfolio of hotel brands.

It has been the third largest health insurance in the nation. On November 16, 2006, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Humana Inc. partnered to expand on traditional private-sector approaches to population health management. In 2006, Humana launched an education campaign to market Medicare Advantage (MA) and Prescription Drug Plans (PDP) nationwide to Medicare eligible consumers, following the passage of the Medicare modernization act. In July 3, 2015, Aetna announced that it will acquire Humana for $37 billion in cash and stock (approximately $230 a share at that time). Aetna and Humana shareholders will own 74% and 26% of the new combined company. In 1993 Humana founded Humana Military Healthcare Services (HMHS) as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1999 season One of Michael Moore's The Awful Truth (TV series) featured Humana refusing to pay for a diabetic patient with pancreatic failure needing a transplant. Michael Moore's 2007 documentary Sicko used the video of Linda Peeno's testimony. On June 28, 2007, Humana declared that Peeno was never a Humana ""associate"" (permanent, full-time employee), but rather a ""part-time contractor"". Humana disputed portions of her Congressional testimony by saying that because the patient's healthcare plan did not cover heart transplants, denial of coverage was valid. Douglas Elmendorf, the head of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) supported the claim that Medicare benefits could be cut,"

(January 2010) Illinois Tool Works Ring carriers produce about 47% less emissions released into the atmosphere than paperboard cartons and about 36% less than shrink-film 6-pack packages. From taking a look at their activities, environmental coordinators were able to have certain products reformulated to less environmentally damaging products. Also, certain processes were amended to have a reduced environmental impact.The company took another look at the possibilities of reducing and recycling waste, maximizing the efficient use of natural resources, and delivering environmental awareness training to the whole of the work force. This last activity led to the creation of an Environmental Team comprising seven volunteers from the workforce to further environmental improvements and in March 2004 the Company received Green Dragon Level 5 Standard. The Political Economy Research Institute ranks ITW 100th among corporations emitting airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on the quantity (0.9 million pounds in 2005) and toxicity of the emissions.

Illumina_(company)," Illumina, Inc. Type Public (NASDAQ:&#160;ILMN) Industry Biotechnology Founded 1998 Founder David Walt Larry Bock John Stuelpnagel Anthony Czarnik Mark Chee Headquarters San Diego, California, U.S. Key people Jay Flatley (CEO) Revenue $1.628 billion (2015) Website www.illumina.com Illumina, Inc. is an American company incorporated in April 1998 that develops, manufactures and markets integrated systems for the analysis of genetic variation and biological function. In 2014, Illumina was named the world's smartest company by MIT Technology Review. Using its technologies, the company provides a line of products and services that serve the sequencing, genotyping and gene expression markets. This technology had purportedly by 2013 reduced the cost of sequencing a human genome to US$4,000, down from a price of US$1 million in 2007. Illumina was founded in April 1998 by David Walt, Larry Bock, John Stuelpnagel, Anthony Czarnik, and Mark Chee. While working with CW Group, a venture capital firm, Bock and Stuelpnagel uncovered what would become Illumina's BeadArray technology at Tufts University and negotiated an exclusive license to that technology. Illumina completed its initial public offering in July 2000. Illumina began offering single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping services in 2001 and launched its first system, the Illumina BeadLab, in 2002, using GoldenGate Genotyping technology. Illumina currently offers microarray-based products and services for an expanding range of genetic analysis sequencing, including SNP genotyping, gene expression, and protein analysis. Illumina's technologies are used by a broad range of academic, government, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other leading institutions around the globe. On January 26, 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Hayward based Solexa, Inc. Solexa Ltd,based in Cambridge UK was founded in June 1998 by Shankar Balasubramanian, and David Klenerman to develop and commercialize genome sequencing technology invented by the founders in the University of Cambridge. Solexa INC was formed 2005 when Solexa Ltd reversed into Lynx Therapeutics of Hayward. technology uses also the DNA colony sequencing technology, invented in 1997 by Pascal Mayer and Laurent Farinelli  and which was acquired by Solexa in 2004 from the company Manteia Predictive Medicine. It is being used to perform a range of analyses, including whole genome resequencing, gene expression analysis and small ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis. In June 2009, Illumina announced the launch of their own Personal Full Genome Sequencing Service at a depth of 30X for $48,000 per genome, Roche tried other tactics, including raising its offer (to $51.00, for about $6.8 billion). Main articles: Illumina (Solexa) sequencing and Illumina dye sequencing Illumina sells a number of very high-throughput DNA sequencing systems, also known as DNA sequencers, based on technology developed by Solexa. The technology features bridge amplification to generate clusters and reversible terminators for sequence determination. Full genome sequencing service is sold solely through health care professionals (not direct to consumer). References ^ a b c Staff (April 15, 2013). ""Genomics"". Disruptors.

Website www.intel.com Intel Corporation (better known as Intel, stylized as intel) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Santa Clara, California. Intel is one of the world's largest and highest valued semiconductor chip makers, based on revenue. It is the inventor of the x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most personal computers. Intel supplies processors for computer system manufacturers such as Apple, Samsung, HP and Dell. Intel also makes motherboard chipsets, network interface controllers and integrated circuits, flash memory, graphics chips, embedded processors and other devices related to communications and computing. Intel Corporation was founded on July 18, 1968 by semiconductor pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore and widely associated with the executive leadership and vision of Andrew Grove, Intel combines advanced chip design capability with a leading-edge manufacturing capability. Intel was an early developer of SRAM and DRAM memory chips, which represented the majority of its business until 1981. Although Intel created the world's first commercial microprocessor chip in 1971, it was not until the success of the personal computer (PC) that this became its primary business. During the 1990s, Intel invested heavily in new microprocessor designs fostering the rapid growth of the computer industry. During this period Intel became the dominant supplier of microprocessors for PCs, and was known for aggressive and anti-competitive tactics in defense of its market position, particularly against Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), as well as a struggle with Microsoft for control over the direction of the PC industry. In June 2013, Intel unveiled its fourth generation of Intel Core processors (Haswell) in an event named Computex in Taipei. The Open Source Technology Center at Intel hosts PowerTOP and LatencyTOP, and supports other open-source projects such as Wayland, Intel Array Building Blocks, Threading Building Blocks (TBB), and Xen.

Moore (of ""Moore's Law"" fame), a chemist, and Robert Noyce, a physicist and co-inventor of the integrated circuit. Arthur Rock (investor and venture capitalist) helped them find investors, while Max Palevsky was on the board from an early stage. The total initial investment in Intel was $2.5 million convertible debentures and $10,000 from Rock. Just 2 years later, Intel completed their initial public offering (IPO), raising $6.8 million ($23.50 per share). At its founding, Intel was distinguished by its ability to make semiconductors. Its first product, in 1969, was the 3101 Schottky TTL bipolar 64-bit static random-access memory (SRAM), which was nearly twice as fast as earlier Schottky diode implementations by Fairchild and the Electrotechnical Laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan. In the same year Intel also produced the 3301 Schottky bipolar 1024-bit read-only memory (ROM) and the first commercial metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) silicon gate SRAM chip, the 256-bit 1101. Intel's business grew during the 1970s as it expanded and improved its manufacturing processes and produced a wider range of products, still dominated by various memory devices. Federico Faggin, the designer of Intel 4004 While Intel created the first commercially available microprocessor (Intel 4004) in 1971 by the early 1980s its business was dominated by dynamic random-access memory chips. However, increased competition from Japanese semiconductor manufacturers had, by 1983, dramatically reduced the profitability of this market. The growing success of the IBM personal computer, based on an Intel microprocessor, was among factors that convinced Gordon Moore (CEO since 1975) to shift the company's focus to microprocessors, and to change fundamental aspects of that business model. Moore's decision to sole-source Intel's 386 chip played into the company's continuing success. By the end of the 1980s, buoyed by its fortuitous position as microprocessor supplier to IBM and IBM's competitors within the rapidly growing personal computer market, Intel embarked on a 10-year period of unprecedented growth as the primary (and most profitable) hardware supplier to the PC industry, part of the winning 'Wintel' combination. Moore handed over to Andy Grove in 1987. By launching its Intel Inside marketing campaign in 1991, Intel was able to associate brand loyalty with consumer selection, so that by the end of the 1990s, its line of Pentium processors had become a household name. Slowing demand and challenges to dominance After 2000, growth in demand for high-end microprocessors slowed. Competitors, notably AMD (Intel's largest competitor in its primary x86 architecture market), garnered significant market share, initially in low-end and mid-range processors but ultimately across the product range, and Intel's dominant position in its core market was greatly reduced. In the early 2000s then-CEO Craig Barrett attempted to diversify the company's business beyond semiconductors, but few of these activities were ultimately successful. Intel had also for a number of years been embroiled in litigation. US law did not initially recognize intellectual property rights related to microprocessor topology (circuit layouts), until the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984, a law sought by Intel and the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). During the late 1980s and 1990s (after this law was passed), Intel also sued companies that tried to develop competitor chips to the 80386 CPU. Antitrust allegations had been simmering since the early 1990s and had been the cause of one lawsuit against Intel in 1991. In 2004 and 2005, AMD brought further claims against Intel related to unfair competition. In 2005, CEO Paul Otellini reorganized the company to refocus its core processor and chipset business on platforms (enterprise, digital home, digital health, and mobility). Regaining of momentum In July 2012, Intel Corporation agreed to buy 10 percent shares of ASML Holding NV for $2.1 billion and another $1 billon for 5 percent shares that need shareholder approval to fund relevant research and development efforts, as part of a EUR3.3 billion ($4.1 billion) deal to accelerate the development of 450-millimeter wafer technology and extreme ultra-violet lithography by as much as two years. The acquisition of a Spanish natural language recognition startup named Indisys was announced on September 13, 2013. The terms of the deal were not disclosed but an email from an Intel representative stated: ""Intel has acquired Indisys, a privately held company based in Seville, Spain. The majority of Indisys employees joined Intel. We signed the agreement to acquire the company on May 31 and the deal has been completed."" Indysis explains that its artificial intelligence (AI) technology ""is a human image, which converses fluently and with common sense in multiple languages and also works in different platforms.""

The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) was launched in October 2013 and Intel is part of the coalition of public and private organisations that also includes Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. Led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income. Intel's first products were shift register memory and random-access memory integrated circuits, and Intel grew to be a leader in the fiercely competitive DRAM, SRAM, and ROM markets throughout the 1970s. Concurrently, Intel engineers Marcian Hoff, Federico Faggin, Stanley Mazor and Masatoshi Shima invented Intel's first microprocessor. Originally developed for the Japanese company Busicom to replace a number of ASICs in a calculator already produced by Busicom, the Intel 4004 was introduced to the mass market on November 15, 1971, though the microprocessor did not become the core of Intel's business until the mid-1980s. (Note: Intel is usually given credit with Texas Instruments for the almost-simultaneous invention of the microprocessor) From DRAM to microprocessors The die from an Intel 8742, an 8-bit microcontroller that includes a CPU running at 12&#160;MHz, 128 bytes of RAM, 2048 bytes of EPROM, and I/O in the same chip Despite the ultimate importance of the microprocessor, the 4004 and its successors the 8008 and the 8080 were never major revenue contributors at Intel. As the next processor, the 8086 (and its variant the 8088) was completed in 1978, Intel embarked on a major marketing and sales campaign for that chip nicknamed ""Operation Crush"", and intended to win as many customers for the processor as possible. One design win was the newly created IBM PC division, though the importance of this was not fully realized at the time. IBM introduced its personal computer in 1981, and it was rapidly successful. In 1982, Intel created the 80286 microprocessor, which, two years later, was used in the IBM PC/AT. Compaq, the first IBM PC ""clone"" manufacturer, produced a desktop system based on the faster 80286 processor in 1985 and in 1986 quickly followed with the first 80386-based system, beating IBM and establishing a competitive market for PC-compatible systems and setting up Intel as a key component supplier. In 1975, the company had started a project to develop a highly advanced 32-bit microprocessor, finally released in 1981 as the Intel iAPX 432. The project was too ambitious and the processor was never able to meet its performance objectives, and it failed in the marketplace. Intel extended the x86 architecture to 32 bits instead. Intel introduced the 486 microprocessor in 1989, and in 1990 formally established a second design team, designing the processors code-named ""P5"" and ""P6"" in parallel and committing to a major new processor every two years, versus the four or more years such designs had previously taken. Engineers Vinod Dham and Rajeev Chandrasekhar (Member of Parliament, India) were key figures on the core team that invented the 486 chip and later, Intel's signature Pentium chip. The P5 was earlier known as ""Operation Bicycle,"" referring to the cycles of the processor. The P5 was introduced in 1993 as the Intel Pentium, substituting a registered trademark name for the former part number (numbers, such as 486, are hard to register as a trademark). The P6 followed in 1995 as the Pentium Pro and improved into the Pentium II in 1997. New architectures were developed alternately in Santa Clara, California and Hillsboro, Oregon. The Santa Clara design team embarked in 1993 on a successor to the x86 architecture, codenamed ""P7"". The first attempt was dropped a year later, but quickly revived in a cooperative program with Hewlett-Packard engineers, though Intel soon took over primary design responsibility. The resulting implementation of the IA-64 64-bit architecture was the Itanium, finally introduced in June 2001. The Itanium's performance running legacy x86 code did not meet expectations, and it failed to compete effectively with x86-64, which was AMD's 64-bit extensions to the original x86 architecture (Intel uses the name Intel 64, previously EM64T). As of 2012, Intel continues to develop and deploy the Itanium; known planning continues into 2014. The Hillsboro team designed the Willamette processors (initially code-named P68), which were marketed as the Pentium 4. This campaign established Intel, which had been a component supplier little-known outside the PC industry, as a household name. The second program is little-known: Intel's Systems Group began, in the early 1990s, manufacturing PC ""motherboards"", the main board component of a personal computer, and the one into which the processor (CPU) and memory (RAM) chips are plugged. During the 1990s, Intel's Architecture Lab (IAL) was responsible for many of the hardware innovations of the personal computer, including the PCI Bus, the PCI Express (PCIe) bus, the Universal Serial Bus (USB). IAL's software efforts met with a more mixed fate; its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital video, but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from Microsoft. The competition between Intel and Microsoft was revealed in testimony by IAL Vice-President Steven McGeady at the Microsoft antitrust trial. Solid-state drives (SSD) It has been suggested that this section be split into an article titled Intel solid-state drives. (Discuss) (January 2014) An Intel X25-M SSD On September 8, 2008, Intel began shipping its first mainstream solid-state drives, the X18-M and X25-M with 80GB and 160GB storage capacities.

In the late 1990s, Sprecher acquired Continental Power Exchange, Inc. with the objective of developing an Internet-based platform to provide a more transparent and efficient market structure for OTC energy commodity trading.(Popper 2013) who represent some of the world's largest energy traders. The new exchange offered the trading community better price transparency, more efficiency, greater liquidity and lower costs than manual trading. While the company's original focus was energy products (crude and refined oil, natural gas, power, and emissions), acquisitions have expanded its activity into soft commodities (sugar, cotton and coffee), foreign exchange and equity index futures. In a response to US financial crisis in 2008, Sprecher formed ICE US Trust based in New York, now called ICE Clear Credit LLC, to serve as a limited-purpose bank, a clearing house for credit default swaps. Sprecher worked closely with the Federal Reserve to serve as its over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives clearing house. ""US regulators were keen on the kind of clearing house for opaque over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives as a risk management device. In the absence of a central counterparty - which would guarantee pay-outs should a trading party be unable to do so - there was a high risk of massive market disruption(Weitzman 2008)"" The principal backers for ICE US Trust were the same financial institutions most affected by the crisis, the top ten of the world's largest banks (Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and UBS). Sprecher's clearing house cleared their global credit default swaps (CDS) in exchange for sharing profits with these banks.(Weitzman 2008)(Terhune 2010). By 30 September 2008 the Financial Post warned that the ""$54000bn credit derivatives market faced its biggest test in October 2008 as billions of dollars worth of contracts on now-defaulted derivatives would be auctioned by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association . In his article in the Financial Post,(Weitzman 2008) described ICE as a ""US-based electronic futures exchange"" which raised the stakes on October 30, 2008 in its effort to expand in the $54000 bn credit derivatives market.(Weitzman 2008) By 2010, Intercontinental Exchange had cleared more than $10 trillion in credit default swaps (CDS) through its subsidiaries, ICE Trust CDS (now ICE Clear Credit).(Terhune 2010) The Intercontinental Exchange has had a policy to grow through the acquisition of other exchanges, a number of these have been successful while others have failed due to concerns by regulators or others that the new company would have created a monopoly situation. The major acquisition and attempted acquisitions have included: International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) 2001 In June 2001, ICE expanded its business into futures trading by acquiring the London-based International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), now ICE Futures Europe, which operated Europe's leading open-outcry energy futures exchange. Since 2003, ICE has partnered with the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) to host its electronic marketplaces. In April 2005, the entire ICE portfolio of energy futures became fully electronic and ICE closed International Petroleum Exchange's high profile and historic trading floor. New York Board of Trade (NYBOT) 2005 ICE became a publicly traded company on November 16, 2005, and was added to the Russell 1000 Index on June 30, 2006. The company expanded rapidly in 2007, acquiring the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT), and ChemConnect (a chemical commodity market). Chicago Board of Trade Unsuccessful Bid 2007 Winnipeg Commodity Exchange (WCE) 2007 The Winnipeg Commodity Exchange (WCE) was renamed ICE Futures Canada as of January 1, 2008. In April 2010, ICE acquired Climate Exchange PLC for 395 million pounds ($622 million) and European Climate Exchange (ECX) as part of its purchase. Exchange-traded emissions products were first offered by the European Climate Exchange (ECX), which was established in 2005, by listing products on the ICE Futures Europe's trading platform. ICE Futures Europe is the leading market for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. ICE's ECX products comply with the requirements of the European Union Emission Trading Scheme. NYSE Euronext 2013 Late in the month, Nasdaq was reported to be considering asking either ICE or the Chicago Merc (CME) to join in what would be probably be an $11–12 billion counterbid for NYSE. On April 1, ICE and Nasdaq made an $11.3 billion offer which was rejected April 10 by NYSE. Another week later, ICE and Nasdaq sweetened their offer, including a $.17 increase per share to $42.67 and a $350 million breakup fee if the deal were to encounter regulatory trouble. The two said the offer was a $2 billion (21%) premium over the Deutsche offer and that they had fully committed financing of $3.8 billion from lenders to finance the deal. In December 2012, ICE announced it would buy NYSE Euronext (this time without the involvement of Nasdaq) for $8.2 billion, pending regulatory approval. In September 2014, ICE announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire SuperDerivatives, a leading provider of risk management analytics, financial market data and valuation services. The acquisition was said to accelerate the expansion of ICE’s comprehensive multi-asset class clearing strategy. Terms of the all-cash transaction included a purchase price of approximately $350 million. Completion of the transaction was subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The transaction successfully completed on 7 October 2014. Interactive Data Corporation (IDC) 2015 In October 2015, ICE announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Interactive Data Corporation (IDC), a leading provider of financial market data, analytics and related trading solutions, from Silver Lake, the global leader in technology investing, and Warburg Pincus, a leading global private equity firm focused on growth investing. The acquisition was valued at approximately $5.2 billion, including $3.65 billion in cash and $1.55 billion in ICE common stock, and builds on ICE’s global market data growth strategy by expanding the markets served, adding technology platforms and increasing new data and valuation services. Completion of the transaction was subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The transaction successfully completed on December 14, 2015. Trayport 2015 In November 2015, ICE announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Trayport, a subsidiary of GFI Group, for $650 million in ICE common stock. Trayport licenses its technology platform to serve brokers for electronic and hybrid trade execution primarily in the European over-the-counter (OTC) utility markets. The transaction will enable ICE to provide new services to the European OTC energy markets, including European power, natural gas and coal. Completion of the transaction was subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The transaction successfully completed on December 11, 2015.

IBM manufactures and markets computer hardware, middleware and software, and offers infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. The company originated in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) through the consolidation of The Tabulating Machine Company, the International Time Recording Company, the Computing Scale Company and the Bundy Manufacturing Company. In 2012, Fortune ranked IBM the second largest U.S. firm in terms of number of employees (435,000 worldwide), Other rankings for 2011/2012 include №1 company for leaders (Fortune), №1 green company in the United States (Newsweek), №2 best global brand (Interbrand), №2 most respected company (Barron's), №5 most admired company (Fortune), and №18 most innovative company (Fast Company). Notable company inventions or developments include the automated teller machine (ATM), the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the Universal Product Code (UPC), the financial swap, the Fortran programming language, SABRE airline reservation system, dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), copper wiring in semiconductors, the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) semiconductor manufacturing process, and Watson artificial intelligence. IBM has constantly evolved since its inception. Over the past decade, it has steadily shifted its business mix by exiting commoditizing markets such as PCs, hard disk drives and DRAMs and focusing on higher-value, more profitable markets such as business intelligence, data analytics, business continuity, security, cloud computing, virtualization and green solutions, IBM acquired Kenexa (2012) and SPSS (2009) and PwC's consulting business (2002), spinning off companies like printer manufacturer Lexmark (1991), and selling off product lines like its personal computer and x86 server businesses to Lenovo (2005, 2014). In 2014, IBM announced that it would go ""fabless"" by offloading IBM Micro Electronics semiconductor manufacturing to GlobalFoundries, a leader in advanced technology manufacturing, citing that semiconductor manufacturing is a capital-intensive business which is challenging to operate without scale.

See media help. In the 1880s, technologies emerged that would ultimately form the core of what would become International Business Machines (IBM). Julius E. Pitrat patented the computing scale in 1885; Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888); On June 16, 1911, their four companies were consolidated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint to form the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR). largely through the German subsidiary Dehomag. During the Second World War the company produced small arms for the American war effort (M1 Carbine, and Browning Automatic Rifle). IBM provided translation services for the Nuremberg Trials. In 1947, IBM opened its first office in Bahrain, as well as an office in Saudi Arabia to service the needs of the Arabian-American Oil Company that would grow to become Saudi Business Machines (SBM). IBM Israel, registered on June 8, 1950, was the country's first high-tech firm. The company, located on Allenby Street in Tel Aviv, assembled and repaired punch card machines, sorting machines and tabulators. In 1956, a local plant was opened to produce punch cards, and a year later, the first service center opened, offering computerized data processing services. In 1952, Thomas Watson, Sr., stepped down after almost 40 years at the company helm; his son, Thomas Watson, Jr., was named president. In 1956, the company demonstrated the first practical example of artificial intelligence when Arthur L. Samuel of IBM's Poughkeepsie, New York, laboratory programmed an IBM 704 not merely to play checkers but ""learn"" from its own experience. In 1957, the FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation) scientific programming language was developed. In 1961, Thomas J. Watson, Jr., was elected chairman of the board and Albert L. Williams became company president. The same year IBM developed the SABRE (Semi-Automatic Business-Related Environment) reservation system for American Airlines and introduced the highly successful Selectric typewriter. In 1963, IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flight of the Mercury astronauts. A year later it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to Armonk, New York. The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration, participating in the 1965 Gemini flights, 1966 Saturn flights and 1969 lunar mission. On April 7, 1964, IBM announced the first computer system family, the revolutionary IBM System/360. Sold between 1964 and 1978, it spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their application. In 1974, IBM engineer George J. Laurer developed the Universal Product Code. In 2002, IBM acquired PwC consulting. In 2003 it initiated a project to redefine company values. Using its Jam technology, it hosted a three-day Internet-based online discussion of key business issues with 50,000 employees. Results were data mined with sophisticated text analysis software (eClassifier) for common themes. Three emerged, expressed as: ""Dedication to every client's success"", ""Innovation that matters—for our company and for the world"", and ""Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships"". The following month, IBM acquired Strongloop, an API developer, in order to position itself for the coming ""internet of things"". On October 28, 2015, IBM announced its acquisition of digital assets from The Weather Company—a holding company of Bain Capital, The Blackstone Group and NBCUniversal which owns The Weather Channel, including its weather data platforms (such as Weather Services International), websites (Weather.com and Weather Underground) and mobile apps. The acquisition seeks to use Watson for weather analytics and predictions. The acquisition does not include The Weather Channel itself, which will enter into a long-term licensing agreement with IBM for use of its data. №1 company for leaders (Fortune) №2 green company in the U.S. (Newsweek) №2 best global brand (Interbrand) №2 most respected company (Barron's) №5 most admired company (Fortune) №18 most innovative company (Fast Company) For 2012, IBM's brand was valued by Interbrand at $75.5 billion. The 283,000-square-foot (26,300&#160;m2) glass and stone building sits on a 25-acre (10&#160;ha) parcel amid a 432-acre former apple orchard the company purchased in the mid-1950s. The company's 14 member Board of Directors is responsible for overall corporate management. As of Cathie Black's resignation in November 2010 its membership (by affiliation and year of joining) included: Alain J. P. Belda '08 (Alcoa), William R.

Pei IBM Japan Makuhari Technical Center, designed by Yoshio Taniguchi IBM Haifa Research Lab, Israel Work environment IBM's employee management practices can be traced back to its roots. In 1914, CEO Thomas J. Watson boosted company spirit by creating employee sports teams, hosting family outings, and furnishing a company band. IBM sports teams still continue in the present day; the IBM Big Blue continue to exist as semi-professional company rugby and American football teams. In 1924 the Quarter Century Club, which recognizes employees with 25 years of service, was organized and the first issue of Business Machines, IBM's internal publication, was published. In 1925, the first meeting of the Hundred Percent Club, composed of IBM salesmen who meet their quotas, convened in Atlantic City, New Jersey. IBM was among the first corporations to provide group life insurance (1934), survivor benefits (1935) and paid vacations (1937). In 1932 IBM created an Education Department to oversee training for employees, which oversaw the completion of the IBM Schoolhouse at Endicott in 1933. In 1935, the employee magazine Think was created. Also that year, IBM held its first training class for female systems service professionals. In 1942, IBM launched a program to train and employ disabled people in Topeka, Kansas. The next year classes began in New York City, and soon the company was asked to join the President's Committee for Employment of the Handicapped. In 1946, the company hired its first black salesman, 18 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 1947, IBM announced a Total and Permanent Disability Income Plan for employees. A vested rights pension was added to the IBM retirement plan. During IBM's management transformation in the 1990s revisions were made to these pension plans to reduce IBM's pension liabilities. On October 10, 2005, IBM became the first major company in the world to commit formally to not use genetic information in employment decisions. The announcement was made shortly after IBM began working with the National Geographic Society on its Genographic Project. IBM provides same-sex partners of its employees with health benefits and provides an anti-discrimination clause. The Human Rights Campaign has consistently rated IBM 100% on its index of gay-friendliness since 2003 (in 2002, the year it began compiling its report on major companies, IBM scored 86%). A dark (or gray) suit, white shirt, and a ""sincere"" tie In 1966, IBM researcher Robert H. Dennard invented dynamic random access memory (DRAM) cells, one-transistor memory cells that store each single bit of information as an electrical charge in an electronic circuit. The technology permits major increases in memory density and is widely adopted throughout the industry where it remains in widespread use today. IBM has been a leading proponent of the Open Source Initiative, and began supporting Linux in 1998. IBM has also released code under different open source licenses, such as the platform-independent software framework Eclipse (worth approximately US$40 million at the time of the donation), the three-sentence International Components for Unicode (ICU) license, and the Java-based relational database management system (RDBMS) Apache Derby. IBM's open source involvement has not been trouble-free, however (see SCO v. IBM). In 2013, Booz and Company (now known as Strategy&amp;, a subsidiary of PricewaterhouseCoopers) placed IBM sixteenth among the 20 most innovative companies in the world. The company spends 6% of its revenue ($6.3 billion) in research and development. Famous inventions and developments by IBM include the following: Automated teller machine (ATM) Floppy disk Hard disk drive Electronic keypunch Magnetic stripe card Virtual machine Scanning tunneling microscope Reduced instruction set computing Relational database Universal Product Code (UPC) Financial swap SABRE airline reservation system Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) Watson artificial intelligence IBM and the University of Michigan announced they are developing a computer that can respond to conversation in the same way humans speak to each other. Project Sapphire is a $4.5 million undertaking that will first see computers act as an academic adviser for undergraduate computer science and engineering students at the university. DeveloperWorks is a website run by IBM for software developers and IT professionals. It contains how-to articles and tutorials, as well as software downloads and code samples, discussion forums, podcasts, blogs, wikis, and other resources for developers and technical professionals.

Polak &amp; Schwarz was founded in 1889 by Leopold Schwarz, who had an interest in spices, flavors and fragrances, and his brother-in-law, Joseph Polak in the small Dutch town of Zutphen. P&amp;S quickly grew to 36 sites globally. Arnold Louis (A.L.) van Ameringen was hired by Polak &amp; Schwarz to open P&amp;S's US office in 1917 before losing his job with them. Relieved of his duties, he opened van Ameringen &amp; Co. at 13 Gold Street in Manhattan, took over Morana, Inc. in 1920, and became van Ameringen-Haebler (VAH) in 1929. van Ameringen is credited with suggesting to bar soap and detergent manufacturers that they scent their products to boost sales. The two companies did well through the bulk of the 20th century, despite difficulties for P&amp;S during World War II. While both companies managed flavors and fragrances, Polak &amp; Schwarz had particular strengths in flavors and van Ameringen-Haebler built a powerful reputation in fragrances. In 1958, the two companies announced their merger to become International Flavors &amp; Fragrances Inc. IFF was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1964. In 2000, IFF acquired Bush Boake Allen with its complementary products, technologies,and presence in key markets, making IFF the largest flavor and fragrance house in the world for several years.

SRI developed a prototype robotic surgical system that caught the interest of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which was interested in the system for its potential to allow surgeons to operate remotely on soldiers wounded on the battlefield. In 1994, Dr. Frederic Moll became interested in the SRI System, as the device was known at the time. At the time, Moll was employed by Guidant. He tried to interest Guidant in backing it, to no avail. In 1995, Moll was introduced to John Freund, who had recently left Acuson Corporation. Freund negotiated an option to acquire SRI's intellectual property and incorporated a new company that he named Intuitive Surgical Devices, Inc. At that point Freund, Moll, and Robert Younge (also from Acuson) wrote the business plan for the company and raised its initial venture capital. Early investors included the Mayfield Fund, Sierra Ventures, and Morgan Stanley. The company refined the SRI System into a prototype known originally as ""Lenny"" (after the young Leonardo da Vinci), which was ready for testing in 1997. As the company's prototypes became more advanced, they were named using da Vinci themes. One was named ""Leonardo"", and another was ""Mona"". The final version of the prototype was nicknamed the da Vinci Surgical System, and the name stuck when the system was eventually commercialized. After further testing, Intuitive Surgical began marketing this system in Europe in 1999, while awaiting FDA approval in the United States. The ZEUS system was ultimately phased out in favor of the da Vinci system. Before the buyout of Computer Motion, the stock of Intuitive was selling at around $14 per share, adjusted for stock splits. After the merger, the stock price rose significantly (and by 2015 it was at about $500), primarily because of the growth in systems sold (60 in 2002 compared with 431 in 2014) and the number of surgical procedures performed (less than 1,000 in 2002 compared with 540,000 in 2014). da Vinci Surgical System ^ a b c d e f g h ""INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC 2013 Annual Report Form (10-K)"" (XBRL).

By 1950, the mushroom market had shifted and Knaust was looking for alternative uses for his mine, which he had named ""Iron Mountain."" Founding and early years (1951–1970) Amid widespread Cold War fears, Knaust saw a business opportunity in protecting corporate information from nuclear attack and other disasters. In 1951 the company, originally known as ""Iron Mountain Atomic Storage Corporation"", opened its first underground ""vaults"" and its first sales office in the Empire State Building, about 125 miles (201&#160;km) south. Iron Mountain's first customer was East River Savings Bank, who brought microfilm copies of deposit records and duplicate signature cards in armored cars for storage in the mountain facility. In 1978, the company opened its first above-ground records-storage facility. Middle years (1970–2000) This first iteration of Iron Mountain was bankrupt by the early 1970s and was wholly acquired by Vincent J. Ryan, through his holdings in Schooner Capital Corpation, Boston, Massachusetts. At the time it consisted of the original facility in Livingston, New York, and IMAR (Iron Mountain at Rosendale), a former limestone mine and mushroom cave outside of Kingston, New York. In 1980, it expanded to Rhode Island through the purchase of a former Industrial National Bank (a precursor to FleetBoston) cold site and data tape repository in Glocester, Rhode Island. Though it had many Fortune 500 clients at the time, its revenue was in the $6 million range in the early 1980s. Its breakthrough came in the mid-1980s when it convinced Manufacturer's Hanover Bank to move all its paper records out of Manhattan to the above mentioned above-ground facility, a former strip mall in Port Ewen, New York. This was the first time bar codes were used by a records management company to allow real time access to shipped boxes,and therefore, the documents inside. The barcoding of boxes of paper records and the subsequent rolling up of ""Mom and Pop"" facilities around the country made expansion easy from there on out. Its ""sell or be put out of business"" mindset was instrumental to the firm's growth. During the 1980s, the company expanded beyond New York, opening facilities in New Jersey and throughout New England. In 1988 Iron Mountain extended its reach into 12 more U.S. markets by acquiring Bell &amp; Howell Records Management, Inc. The firm went public on January 31st of 1996. In 1997, Iron Mountain became a leading software escrow company with the acquisition of Data Securities International (DSI). Expansion and consolidation (2000–present) Iron Mountain Vehicle Since 1980, Iron Mountain grew through acquisitions. Revenue over this period increased from $3 million in 1981 to $2.7 billion at the end of 2007. In February, 2000, Iron Mountain Incorporated announced the completion of its acquisition of Pierce Leahy Corp. (NYSE:PLH) in a stock-for-stock merger valued at approximately $1.1 billion. one of the larger e-discovery service providers at the production end of the Electronic Discovery Reference Model (EDRM). Shortly thereafter, in August 2011, Hewlett-Packard acquired the Cambridge based Autonomy, and amalgamated the operations of Autonomy (which included Iron Mountain Digital) into HP's enterprise software division. The best known Iron Mountain storage facility is a high-security storage facility in a former limestone mine at Boyers, Pennsylvania, near the city of Butler in the United States (41°05′35″N 79°54′40″W﻿ / ﻿41.093°N 79.911°W﻿ / 41.093; -79.911). It began storing records in 1954 and was purchased by Iron Mountain in 1998. It is here that Bill Gates stores his Corbis photographic collection in a refrigerated cave 220 feet (67&#160;m) underground. The company has received media attention for losing or misplacing customer files and data, particularly tapes containing private information such as home addresses and Social Security numbers. In 1997 a mysterious fire destroyed a warehouse just off the New Jersey Turnpike (USA) at Exit 8, full of corporate documents. This was two days after a smaller blaze damaged another warehouse several hundred feet away. ^ a b Boston Business Journal by Tom Witkowski (2002-05-20).

In 1977, two subsidiary companies were created; McNeil medicals products and McNeil Consumer Products Company (also known as McNeil Consumer Healthcare). The focus of McNeil medicals products is to market prescription drugs. In 1993 McNeil medicals products merged with the Ortho Pharmaceutical to form Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical. In 2001 McNeil Consumer Healthcare changed its name to McNeil Consumer &amp; Specialty medicals products. However, it was later changed to ""McNeil Consumer Healthcare"". The company markets over-the-counter and prescription medicals products including complete lines of Tylenol and Motrin IB (ibuprofen) products for adults and children. 1959: Cilag In 1933, Swiss chemist Bernhard Joos set up a small research laboratory in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. This set the basis for the founding of Chemische Industrie-Labor AG (Chemical Industry Laboratory AG or Cilag) on 12 May 1936. In 1959, Cilag joined the Johnson &amp; Johnson family of companies. In the early nineties the marketing organizations of Cilag and Janssen Pharmaceutica were joined to form Janssen-Cilag. The non-marketing activities of both companies still operate under their original name. Cilag continues to have operations under the Cilag name in Switzerland, ranging from research and development through manufacturing and international services. In August 2014 Cilag acquired Covagen a biopharmaceutical company which specialises in the development of multi-specific protein based therapeutics. As part of the acquisition Cilag wll gain access to Covagen’s lead drug candidate, COVA 322, a bi-specific anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha/anti-interleukin (IL)-17A FynomAb, is in a Phase Ib study for psoriasis. Paul Janssen founded his own research laboratory in 1953 on the third floor of the building in the Statiestraat, still within the Richter-Eurpharma company of his father. On 5 April 1956, the name of the company was changed to NV Laboratoria Pharmaceutica C. Janssen (named after Constant Janssen). On 2 May 1958, the research department in Beerse became a separate legal entity, the N.V. Research Laboratorium C. Janssen. On 24 October 1961, the company was acquired by the American corporation Johnson &amp; Johnson. On 10 February 1964, the name was changed to Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. Between 1990 and 2004, Janssen Pharmaceuticals expanded worldwide, with the company grew in size to approximately 28000 employees worldwide. In 1999, clinical research and non-clinical development become a global organization within Johnson &amp; Johnson. In 2001, part of the research activities was transferred to the United States with the reorganization of research activities in the Johnson &amp; Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development organization. The research activities of the Janssen Research Foundation and the R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute were merged into the new global research organization. On 27 October 2004, the Paul Janssen Research Center, for discovery research, was inaugurated. In August 2013, the company acquired Aragon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.. In November 2014, the company acquired Alios BioPharma, Inc. for $1.75 billion. As a result of the purchase, Alios was incorporated into the infectious diseases therapeutic area of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson. In March 2015, Janssen licensed Tipofarnib (a farnesyl transferase inhibitor) to Kura Oncology who will assume sole responsibility for developing and commericalisaing the anti-cancer drug. Later in the same month the company announced that Galapagos Pharma and regained the rights to the anti-inflammatory drug candidate GLPG1690 as well as two other compounds including GLPG1205 (a first-in-class inhibitor of GPR84). In June 2011 Centocor Ortho Biotech changed its name to Janssen Biotech, Inc. as part of a global effort to unite the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies around the world under a common identity. In December 2014, the company announced it would co-develop MacroGenics cancer drug candidate (MGD011) which targets both CD19 and CD3 proteins in treating B-cell malignant tumours. This could net MacroGenics up to $700 million. J&amp;J headquarters in Madrid, Spain.

The company considered moving its headquarters out of New Brunswick in the 1960s, but decided to stay in the town after city officials promised to gentrify downtown New Brunswick by demolishing old buildings and constructing new ones. While New Brunswick lost at least one historic edifice (the inn where Rutgers University began) to the redevelopment, the gentrification did attract people back to New Brunswick. Johnson &amp; Johnson hired Henry N. Cobb from Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners to design an addition to its headquarters. The white tower in a park across the railroad tracks from the older portion of the headquarters in one of tallest buildings in New Brunswick. The stretch of Delaware and Raritan canal by the company's headquarters was replaced by a stretch of Route 18 in the late 1970s, Robert Wood Johnson I (1887–1910) James Wood Johnson (1910–1932) Robert Wood Johnson II (1932–1963) Philip B. Hofmann (1963–1973) Richard B. Sellars (1973–1976) James E. Burke (1976–1989) Ralph S. Larsen (1989–2002) William C. Weldon (2002–2012) Alex Gorsky (2012–present) Products The company's major franchises in the Pharmaceutical segment include Immunology, Neuroscience, Infectious Disease, and Oncology. Immunology products include the anti-tumor necrosis factor antibodies Remicade (infliximab), and Simponi (golimumab) used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease (Remicade only), ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other disorders. In 2013, these two products accounted for 29% of Johnson and Johnson's pharmaceutical revenues, and 11.3% of the company's total revenues. A third immunology product, Stelara (ustekinumab), targets interleukin-12 and interleukin-23 and is used for the treatment of psoriasis. Key infectious diseases products include Incivio (telaprevir), a hepatitis C protease inhibitor; Intelence (Etravirine), a non-nucleoside HIV polymerase inhibitor; and Prezista (darunavir), an HIV protease inhibitor. Telaprevir sales are expected to decline due to the recent approval of treatment regimens that are more efficacious and much better tolerated. Etravirine and darunavir are notable for their high barriers to resistance development. but etravirine is approved only for use in treatment-experienced patients, owing in part to its requirement for twice-daily dosing. The company's CNS products include the ADHD drug Concerta (methylphenidate extended release), and the long-acting injectable antipsychotics Invega Sustenna (paliperidone palmitate) and Risperdal Consta (risperidone). Invega Sustenna and Risperdal Consta were the first widely utilized long-acting depot injections for the treatment of schizophrenia. Designed to address the issue of poor patient compliance with oral therapy, they are administered by intramuscular injection at intervals of 2 weeks and one month, respectively. Only minimal improvements in outcomes relative to the oral versions of these drugs were observed in the clinical trial setting, but some evidence suggests that the advantages of long-acting injections in clinical practice may be greater than is readily demonstrated in the environment of a clinical trial. Oncology products include Velcade (bortezomib), for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma and Zytiga (abiraterone), an androgen antagonist for the treatment of prostate cancer. In clinical trials, abiraterone treatment was associated with a 4.6 to 5.2 survival advantage when used either before or after chemotherapy with platinum based drugs.

DePuy said the recall was due to unpublished National Joint Registry data showing a 12% revision rate for resurfacing at five years and an ASR XL revision rate of 13%. All hip prostheses fail in some patients, but it is expected that the rate will be about 1% a year. States that have awarded damages include Texas ($158 million), South Carolina ($327 million), Louisiana ($258 million), and most notably Arkansas ($1.2 billion). The allegations include that J&amp;J were warned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) not to promote Risperdal as effective and safe for elderly patients, but they did so, and that they paid Omnicare to promote the drug to care home physicians. The Geneva Conventions, which reserved the Red Cross emblem for specific uses, were first approved in 1864 and ratified by the United States in 1882; however, the emblem was not protected by U.S. law for the use of the American Red Cross and the U.S. military until after Johnson &amp; Johnson had obtained its trademark. A clause in this law (now 18 U.S.C. 706) permits this pre-existing uses of the Red Cross to continue. A declaration made by the U.S. upon its ratification of the 1949 Geneva Conventions includes a reservation that pre-1905 U.S. domestic uses of the Red Cross, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson's, would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on ""aircraft, vessels, vehicles, buildings or other structures, or upon the ground,"" i.e. uses which could be confused with its military uses. In August 2007, Johnson &amp; Johnson filed a lawsuit against the American Red Cross (ARC), demanding that the charity halt the use of the red cross symbol on products it sells to the public, though the company takes no issue with the charity's use of the mark for non-profit purposes.

In 1824, the company amended its charter to perform banking activities and created the Chemical Bank of New York. After 1851, the bank was separated from its parent and grew organically and through a series of mergers, most notably with Corn Exchange Bank in 1954, Texas Commerce Bank (a large bank in Texas) in 1986, and Manufacturer's Hanover Trust Company in 1991 (the first major bank merger ""among equals""). In the 1980s and early 1990s, Chemical emerged as one of the leaders in the financing of leveraged buyout transactions. In 1984, Chemical launched Chemical Venture Partners to invest in private equity transactions alongside various financial sponsors. By the late 1980s, Chemical developed its reputation for financing buyouts, building a syndicated leveraged finance business and related advisory businesses under the auspices of pioneering investment banker, Jimmy Lee. At many points throughout this history, Chemical Bank was the largest bank in the United States (either in terms of assets or deposit market share). In 1996, Chemical Bank acquired Chase Manhattan. Although Chemical was the nominal survivor, it took the better-known Chase name. To this day, JPMorgan Chase retains Chemical's pre-1996 stock price history, as well as Chemical's former headquarters at 270 Park Avenue.

Morgan &amp; Co. The J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. logo before its merger with Chase Manhattan Bank in 2000 Influence of J.P. Morgan in Large Corporations, 1914 The J.P. Morgan headquarters in New York City following the September 16, 1920 bomb explosion that took the lives of 38 and injured over 400 The heritage of the House of Morgan traces its roots to the partnership of Drexel, Morgan &amp; Co., which in 1895 was renamed J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. (see also: J. Pierpont Morgan). Arguably the most influential financial institution of its era, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. financed the formation of the United States Steel Corporation, which took over the business of Andrew Carnegie and others and was the world's first billion dollar corporation. In 1895, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. supplied the United States government with $62&#160;million in gold to float a bond issue and restore the treasury surplus of $100&#160;million. In 1892, the company began to finance the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and led it through a series of acquisitions that made it the dominant railroad transporter in New England. Built in 1914, 23 Wall Street was known as the ""House of Morgan"", and for decades the bank's headquarters was the most important address in American finance. At noon, on September 16, 1920, a terrorist bomb exploded in front of the bank, injuring 400 and killing 38. Shortly before the bomb went off, a warning note was placed in a mailbox at the corner of Cedar Street and Broadway. The warning read: ""Remember we will not tolerate any longer. Free the political prisoners or it will be sure death for all of you. American Anarchists Fighters."" While there are many hypotheses regarding who was behind the bombing and why they did it, after 20 years of investigation the FBI rendered the case inactive without ever finding the perpetrators. In August 1914, Henry P. Davison, a Morgan partner, traveled to the UK and made a deal with the Bank of England to make J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. the monopoly underwriter of war bonds for the UK and France. The Bank of England became a ""fiscal agent"" of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., and vice versa. The company also invested in the suppliers of war equipment to Britain and France. Thus, the company profited from the financing and purchasing activities of the two European governments. In the 1930s, all of J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. along with all integrated banking businesses in the United States, was required by the provisions of the Glass–Steagall Act to separate its investment banking from its commercial banking operations. J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. chose to operate as a commercial bank, because at the time commercial lending was perceived as more profitable and prestigious. Additionally, many within J.P. Morgan believed that a change in political climate would eventually allow the company to resume its securities businesses but it would be nearly impossible to reconstitute the bank if it were disassembled. In 1935, after being barred from securities business for over a year, the heads of J.P. Morgan spun off its investment-banking operations. Led by J.P. Morgan partners, Henry S. Morgan (son of Jack Morgan and grandson of J. Pierpont Morgan) and Harold Stanley, Morgan Stanley was founded on September 16, 1935, with $6.6&#160;million of nonvoting preferred stock from J.P. Morgan partners. In order to bolster its position, in 1959, J.P. Morgan merged with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York to form the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company. The bank would continue to operate as Morgan Guaranty Trust until the 1980s, before beginning to migrate back toward the use of the J.P. Morgan brand. In 1984, the group finally purchased the Purdue National Corporation of Lafayette Indiana, uniting a history between the two figures of Salmon Portland Chase and John Purdue. In 1988, the company once again began operating exclusively as J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. Bank One Corporation On March 24, 2008, after considerable public discontent by Bear Stearns shareholders over the low acquisition price threatened the deal's closure, a revised offer was announced at approximately $10 per share. Under the revised terms, JPMorgan also immediately acquired a 39.5% stake in Bear Stearns (using newly issued shares) at the new offer price and gained a commitment from the board (representing another 10% of the share capital) that its members would vote in favor of the new deal. With sufficient commitments to ensure a successful shareholder vote, the merger was completed on June 2, 2008.

Morgan Securities was fined a record £33.32&#160;million ($49.12&#160;million) by the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) for failing to protect an average of £5.5&#160;billion of clients' money from 2002 to 2009. In July 2013, The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved a stipulation and consent agreement under which JPMorgan Ventures Energy Corporation (JPMVEC), a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., agreed to pay $410 million in penalties and disgorgement to ratepayers for allegations of market manipulation stemming from the company’s bidding activities in electricity markets in California and the Midwest from September 2010 through November 2012. JPMVEC agreed to pay a civil penalty of $285 million to the U.S. Treasury and to disgorge $125 million in unjust profits. JPMVEC admitted the facts set forth in the agreement, but neither admitted nor denied the violations. The case stemmed from multiple referrals to FERC from market monitors in 2011 and 2012 regarding JPMVEC’s bidding practices. FERC investigators determined that JPMVEC engaged in 12 manipulative bidding strategies designed to make profits from power plants that were usually out of the money in the marketplace. In each of them, the company made bids designed to create artificial conditions that forced California and Midcontinent Independent System Operators (ISOs) to pay JPMVEC outside the market at premium rates. Various newspapers reported in September 2013 that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and US Attorney's Office in Manhattan were investigating whether employees withheld information or made false statements during the FERC investigation. On August 25, 2011, JPMorgan Chase agreed to settle fines with regard to violations of the sanctions under the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) regime. The U.S. Department of Treasury released the following civil penalties information under the heading: ""JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.

Main article: Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement On February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a historic settlement with the federal government and 49 states. The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in direct payments to the states and federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. The derivatives team at JPMorgan (including Blythe Masters) was a pioneer in the invention of credit derivatives such as the credit default swap. The first CDS was created to allow Exxon to borrow money from JPMorgan while JPMorgan transferred the risk to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development. JPMorgan's team later created the 'BISTRO', a bundle of credit default swaps that was the progenitor of the Synthetic CDO.

Juniper_Networks," Juniper Networks, Inc. Juniper's headquarters in Sunnyvale Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;JNPR Industry Networking equipment Founded February&#160;6, 1996; 20 years ago&#160;(1996-02-06) Founder Pradeep Sindhu Headquarters Sunnyvale, California, United States Key people Scott Kriens (Chairman) Pradeep Sindhu (Vice Chairman &amp; CTO) Rami Rahim (CEO) Products Routers, switches, security and software Revenue US$ 4.63 billion (2014) Operating income US$ -419.70 million (2014) Total assets US$ $2.97 billion (2014) Number of employees 9,483 (2014) It grew to $4 billion in revenues by 2004 and $4.63 billion in 2014. Juniper appointed Kevin Johnson as CEO in 2008, Shaygan Kheradpir in 2013 and Rami Rahim in 2014. Juniper Networks originally focused on core routers, which are used by internet service providers (ISPs) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere in 2002, Juniper entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. Juniper entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit in 2003, before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. It entered the enterprise segment in the early 2000s, which accounted for one-third of revenues by 2005. As of 2014, Juniper has been focused on developing new software-defined networking products. However, in 2016, the company encountered some controversy under suspicion allegedly putting backdoors into its ScreenOS products.

That February, Juniper reached an agreement with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated Operating Plan (IOP) that involved repurchasing $2 billion in shares, reducing operating expenses by $160 million and appointing two new directors to its board. Juniper made five acquisitions in 2005, mostly of startups with deal values ranging from $8.7 to $337 million. It acquired application-acceleration vendor Redline Networks, VOIP company Kagoor Networks, as well as wide area network (WAN) company Peribit Networks. In 2014 Juniper acquired the software-defined networking (SDN) company WANDL. It incorporated specialized Application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for routing internet traffic that were developed in partnership with IBM. In April 2002, Juniper released the first of the T-series family (originally known under the code-name Gibson), which could perform four times as many route lookups per second as the M160.:9 Juniper's first major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000. Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market. Juniper Networks SRX5800 service gateway and security appliance Juniper Networks introduced the JProtect security toolkit in May 2003. It included firewalls, flow monitoring, filtering and Network Address Translation (NAT). Juniper released its first dedicated Network Access Control (NAC) product in late 2005, which was followed by the acquisition of Funk Software for its NAC capabilities for switches. In December 2015 Juniper Systems announced that they had discovered ""unauthorized code"" in the ScreenOS software that underlies their NetScreen devices, present from 2012 onwards. There were two vulnerabilities: One was a simple root password backdoor, and the other one was changing a point in Dual_EC_DRBG so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting (intentional or unintentional) backdoor in ScreenOS to passively decrypt traffic. According to a 2014 SWOT analysis by MarketLine, in recent history Juniper has been focusing on software-defined networking (SDN). ^ a b c ""Juniper Networks Financial Results"". Juniper.

Starling (CEO &amp; President) Revenue $2418M (2015) Net income $438M (2015) Total equity $3914M (2015) Website www.kcsouthern.com Kansas City Southern is the parent company of the Kansas City Southern Railway, a Class I railroad headquartered in the Quality Hill neighborhood of Kansas City, Missouri, USA. It is also sometimes known as ""The NAFTA Railroad"" in reference to the North American Free Trade Agreement because its operations carry goods between the midwest and Mexico. Kansas City Southern was founded in 1887 by Arthur Edward Stilwell, with the goal of connecting the U.S. heartland to the Gulf of Mexico. An early slogan for the company was ""The shortest route from Kansas City to salt water."" Its original network linked Kansas City with Port Arthur, Texas. Although it remained financially strong, it did not add routes until the 1930s, when it expanded to Louisiana. From 1940 to 1969, KCS offered luxury passenger service between Kansas City and New Orleans, but ceased passenger operations due to the growing popularity of auto and air travel. KCS' next large expansion did not take place until 1993, when it purchased the MidSouth Railroad, which provided its first east-west route, connecting Dallas, Texas to Meridian, Mississippi. Due to KCS' geographic placement, the railroad has benefited from the passage of NAFTA in 1995. KCS also attempted to purchase the Southern Pacific Transportation Company from Southern Pacific Santa Fe Railroad Company, in 1988 and was defeated by the Rio Grande's parent company Rio Grande Industries."

Banana Frosted Flakes Buzz Blasts (based on Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story movies) C-3PO's cereal: Introduced in 1984 and inspired by the multi-lingual droid from Star Wars, the cereal called itself ""a New (crunchy) Force at Breakfast"" and was composed of ""twin rings phased together for two crunches in every double-O"". In other words, they were shaped like the digit 8. After severing the cereal's ties to Star Wars, the company renamed it Pro-Grain and promoted it with sports-oriented commercials. Chocolate Mud &amp; Bugs Frosted Krispies Frosted Rice: This was a combination of Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies, using Rice Krispies with frosting on them. Tony Jr. was the brand's mascot. Fruity Marshmallow Krispies Golden Crackles Golden Oatmeal Crunch (later revised to Golden Crunch) Heartwise (which contained psyllium, an Indian-grown grain used as a laxative and cholesterol-reducer) Homer's Cinnamon Donut Cereal (based on The Simpsons TV cartoon) KOMBOs (orange, strawberry and chocolate flavors) Manufactured approximately from the 1920s to the mid 1960s; based on shreds of wheat but different from shredded wheat in texture. Unlike the latter, it tended to remain crisp in milk. In the Chicago area, Krumbles was available into the late 1960s. It was also high in fiber, although that attribute was not in vogue at the time. Marshmallow Krispies (later revised to Fruity Marshmallow Krispies) Most Mr. T's Muscle Crunch (1983–1985) Nut &amp; Honey Crunch OJ's (""All the Vitamin C of a 4-oz. Glass of Orange Juice"") OKs cereal (early 1960s): Oat-based cereal physically resembling the competing brand Cheerios, with half the OKs shaped like letter O's and the other half shaped like K's, but did not taste like Cheerios. OKs originally featured Big Otis, a giant, burly Scotsman, on the box; this was replaced by the more familiar Yogi Bear. Pep: Best remembered as the sponsor of the Superman radio serial. Pokémon Cereal: A limited edition cereal that contained marshmallow shapes in the forms of Gen I Pokémon Pikachu, Oddish, Poliwhirl and Ditto. Pop-Tarts Crunch Powerpuff Girls Cereal Puffa Puffa Rice (late 1960s–early 1970s) Raisin Squares Woody Woodpecker cereal Yogos (Berry, Mango, Strawberry, 72 Flavor Blast (Germany), Cookies and Cream, Tacos (Mexico)) Yogos Rollers Marketing Kellogg's Sans (typeface used by Kellogg's) Various methods have been used in the company's history to promote the company and its brands. Foremost among these is the design of the Kellogg's logo by Ferris Crane under the art direction of famed type guru Y. Ames. Another was the well-remembered jingle ""K E double-L, O double-good, Kellogg's best to you!"" Some of Kellogg's marketing has been questioned in the press, prompted by an increase in consumer awareness of the mismatch between the marketing messages and the products themselves. Licensed brands have been omitted since the corresponding mascots would be obvious (e.g. Spider-Man is the mascot for Spider-Man Spidey-Berry). Cocoa Hoots cereal: Newton the Owl Cocoa Krispies cereal (Known as Choco Krispis in Latin America, Choco Krispies in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, Chocos in India, and Coco Pops in Australia, the UK, and Europe): Jose (monkey), Coco (monkey), Melvin (elephant), Snagglepuss (Hanna-Barbera character), Ogg (caveman), Tusk (elephant), and Snap, Crackle and Pop (who were also, and remain as of February 2014, the Rice Krispies mascots; see below) Corn Flakes cereal: Cornelius (rooster) Frosted Flakes (known as Frosties outside the US/Canada, Zucaritas in Latin America and Sucrilhos in Brazil) cereal: Tony the Tiger Froot Loops cereal: Toucan Sam Honey Smacks (US)/Smacks (other markets) cereal: Dig 'Em Frog Raisin Bran cereal: Sunny the Sun Rice Krispies (known as Rice Bubbles in Australia) cereal: Snap, Crackle and Pop Ricicles (UK Only) cereal: Captain Rik Apple Jacks cereal: CinnaMon and Bad Apple Honey Loops cereal: Loopy (bumblebee), Pops (honey bee) Keebler cookies and crackers&#160;: Ernie and the Elves Motorsports The suspected chemical that caused the illnesses was 2-methylnaphthalene, used in the cereal packaging process. Little is known about 2-methylnaphthalene's impact on human health as the Food and Drug Administration has no scientific data on its impact on humans, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) also does not have health and safety data. This is despite the EPA having sought information on it from the chemical industry for 16 years. 2-Methylnaphthalene is a component of crude oil, and is ""structurally related to naphthalene, an ingredient in mothballs and toilet-deodorant blocks"" that the EPA considers a possible human carcinogen.

(May 2010) We expect more from a great American company than making dubious claims—not once, but twice—that its cereals improve children's health... —Jon Leibowitz, Chairman of the F.T.C.

In fact, some believed that Gillespie was making all the moves to cover up poor performance, although in hindsight that appears to be far from truth. The concept was dubbed ""burning the furniture,"" implying that Key would sell an asset to obfuscate earnings. For instance, Key sold its residential mortgage servicing to Countrywide Financial in 1995, shareholder services in 1996, various chunks of the bank in 1997-1999 (i.e. Wyoming, Florida, and Long Island), and credit card operations to The Associates in 2000 (which would quickly thereafter be swallowed by Citigroup). But Gillespie was attempting to increase fee-income by acquiring high-growth businesses (like McDonald and equipment financing firm Leastec) and decreasing the exposure to the bank's shrinking population base in its primary footprint, so-called rust belt states such as Ohio, Michigan, and Indiana. Gillespie stepped down as CEO on February 1, 2001, and then as chairman at the annual meeting on May 17. That would usher in the Henry Meyer era. 2002 through present The deal will strengthen Key's position in Upstate New York (which may require branch divestiture) and New England, as well as entering Pennsylvania for the first time with a presence in both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. In Pittsburgh, Key will be a top five bank, and will acquire branches that were once part of crosstown rival National City Corp., which Key had tried to acquire from PNC Financial Services following PNC's takeover of National City in 2008 before being outbid by First Niagara. ^ ""SNL:Data Dispatch: Top 50 US banks"".

Kinder_Morgan," Kinder Morgan Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;KMI S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Oil and gas Founded 1997 Founder Richard Kinder, William V. Morgan Headquarters Houston, Texas, U.S. Area served USA and Canada Key people Richard Kinder (Executive Chairman) Services Pipeline transport Oil storage Number of employees ~13,000 (2016) Website www.kindermorgan.com Company headquarters Kinder Morgan is a company headquartered in downtown Houston, Texas. Their pipelines transport natural gas, refined petroleum products, crude oil, carbon dioxide (CO2) and more. They also store or handle a variety of products and materials at their terminals such as gasoline, jet fuel, ethanol, coal, petroleum coke and steel. Kinder Morgan's CO2 division provides carbon dioxide (CO2) for enhanced oil recovery projects in North America. Kinder Morgan was founded in 1997 when a group of investors acquired the general partner of a small, publicly traded pipeline limited partnership (Enron Liquids Pipeline, L.P., later renamed Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P.). On August 28, 2006, Kinder Morgan announced that it would be taken private in a management-led leveraged buyout totaling approximately $22 billion. Outside participants in the transaction include Fayez Sarofim, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners and Highstar Capital (then owned by American International Group). In October 2011, Kinder Morgan Inc. agreed to buy El Paso Corp. (EP) for $21.1 billion and gave the combined company 67,000 miles (107,000 kilometers) of gas lines, eclipsing Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD) as the biggest U.S. pipeline operator. The transaction paid with shares of Kinder Morgan, Kinder Morgan warrants, and all of cash portion $11.5 billion through Barclays Plc (BARC) borrowing. On December 23, 2013, Kinder Morgan announced that, through its Kinder Morgan Energy partner subsidiary (ticker KMP on NYSE), it would acquire the US oil tanker operator American Petroleum Tankers (APT) and its affiliated company SCT (State Class Tankers) from the US private equity investment firms Blackstone Group and Cerberus Capital management. APT operates a fleet of five US flagged MR 50,000 tons - 330,000 barrels - oil tankers and has four other similar tankers on order from the General Dynamics shipbuilding company NASSCO in California. This acquisition appears to be the first case whereby a pipeline operator will also be able to offer marine transportation. Prior to November 26, 2014, the Kinder Morgan group publicly traded companies included Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE: KMI), Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE: KMP), Kinder Morgan Management, LLC (NYSE: KMR) and El Paso Pipeline Partners, L.P. (NYSE: EPB); a merger transaction combined all under Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE: KMI), on November 26, 2014.

In 2013, Kinder Morgan filed its application to the Canadian National Energy Board (NEB) for building a second pipeline roughly parallel to Trans Mountain, which would nearly triple the transportation capacity from 300,000 to 850,000 barrels per day, for an estimated investment of $5.4 billion. This expansion would enable the export of larger volumes of Alberta's bituminous sands oil to the US and to Asian countries. The Trans mountain pipeline has been called ""controversial""). This project continues to face strong opposition from civic governments, First Nations, environmentally concerned citizens, and others. Protests in November 2014 focused on Kinder Morgan's surveying work. Challenges to Kinder Morgan Pipelines This project is controversial, as are similar pipeline projects Northern Gateway from Alberta to Kitimat, BC, Keystone XL to the US south and Line 9 (Enbridge's project, from Sarnia to Montreal), all of which expand the transportation capacity of heavy crude to refineries or loading ports for export to the US or overseas. Members of the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations of British Columbia, Canada paddled canoes on the waters of Burrard Inlet to the Kinder Morgan Burnaby Terminal for a ceremony to protest the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline, in North Vancouver, B.C., on September 1, 2012. Tsleil-Waututh leaders hoped to shut down the project altogether. This section may lend undue weight to certain ideas, incidents, or controversies. Please help to create a more balanced presentation.

(June 2015) Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Safety Standards The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allows high-pressure 30-42"" diameter interstate natural gas pipelines to be built less than fifty feet away from occupied dwellings. In 2009, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) cited Kinder Morgan for violating safety standards regarding the distance between a natural gas pipeline and a ""high consequence area"" such as a school or hospital; the pipeline was too close for safe operation in case of a leak. Throughout the U.S. since 2003, Kinder Morgan and its subsidiaries' pipelines (of all kinds) have been responsible for more than 400 spills, evacuations, explosions, fires, and fatalities in 24 states, incurring more than 110 federal enforcement actions. Kinder Morgan's natural gas transmission pipeline accidents caused more than $224 million in property damage. This list below is not complete; see the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration operator data at http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov for more incidents. Some notable examples (including spills in Canada): 2003 In August 2003, in Caddo County, Oklahoma, a Kinder Morgan Natural Gas Pipeline of America failed in a rural farming area about just east of the town of Stecker. A 26"" diameter pipe exploded, throwing a 54-foot long section of pipe 30 feet from the ditch. The cause was environmental cracking along the length of the failed section parallel to the longitudinal weld seam. 2004 On April 27, 2004, an underground Kinder Morgan 14"" pipeline ruptured at Suisun Marsh in Solano County, California, spilling over 120,000 gallons of diesel fuel directly into the marsh. The cause was pipe corrosion. The company failed to notify authorities about the spill for 18 hours, another safety violation for which it was later cited. Kinder Morgan was fined $5.3 million for the spill, and agreed to enhance spill prevention, response and reporting practices. The company had 44 spills in 31 months, indicating ""widespread failure to adequately detect and address the effects of outside force damage and corrosion,"" according to an order issued in August 2005 by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). On November 9, 2004, a Kinder Morgan pipeline in Walnut Creek, California was struck by a backhoe, causing a gasoline spill that ignited in an explosive fireball, incinerating five workers and severely injuring four others. CalOSHA (California Occupational Safety and Health Administration) cited Kinder Morgan for failure to accurately mark and map the pipeline location. On November 11, 2006, a subcontractor on Kinder Morgan’s Rockies Express (REX) pipeline outside Cheyenne, Wyoming struck an existing pipeline, causing a rupture and explosion. Two months after this explosion, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission threatened to shut the project down if REX didn’t improve its ""poor compliance record"" involving construction activity outside the approved work area. 2007 On July 24, 2007, the Trans Mountain Pipeline, operated by Kinder Morgan Canada, released over 250,000 litres (1572 barrels) of crude oil (70,000 (440 barrels) of which flowed into Burrard Inlet, requiring a C$15-million cleanup) after a backhoe broke the line in Burnaby. 2009 In May 2009, near Palm City, Florida, a Kinder Morgan Florida Gas Transmission Company 18"" diameter natural gas pipeline ruptured in a sparsely populated rural area of Martin Co. and ""displaced"" about 106 feet of buried pipe onto the right-of-way between Interstate 95 and the Florida Turnpike (SR-91). About 106 feet of pipe weighing about 5,000 pounds was blown out of the ground. The rupture was near a high school that was within the 366-foot potential impact radius (PIR). Injuries included two people in a car that ran off the road and a Sheriff's deputy treated for inhaling gas. 2011 The Carteret, New Jersey, KMLT had a leak and fire during maintenance work on March 14, 2011. On April 4, 2013, the PHMSA Office of Pipeline Safety issued a Notice of Probable Violation, Proposed Civil Penalty and Proposed Compliance Order (NOPV) after an inspection. In 2013, KMLT paid a penalty of $63,100 and was required to complete pipeline integrity testing and other corrective measures by May 2015. The leak was caused by ""displacement produced by a landslide and an inadequate understanding by (TGP) of the influence of the geotechnical threats on the pipeline in this location."" ^ ""Contact Us.""

In three months it purchased three supermarket chains: On May 13, Kroger entered the Houston, Texas market by acquiring the Houston-based 26-store chain Henke &amp; Pillot. In June of that same year Kroger acquired 18-store Krambo Food Stores, Inc. of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area, which at that time had started building six more stores. In late July it purchased Childs Food Stores, Inc. of Jacksonville, Texas. Childs also had a presence in Arkansas and Louisiana. In January 1956, the company bought out Big Chain Stores, Inc., a chain of seven stores based in Shreveport, Louisiana, later combining it with the Childs group. All of these chains adopted the Kroger banner in 1966. Amidst all the acquisitions, in September 1957, Kroger sold off its Wichita, Kansas store division, then consisting of 16 stores, to J. S. Dillon and Sons Stores Company, then headed by Ray S. Dillon, son of the company founder. In October 1963 Kroger acquired the 56-store chain Market Basket, providing them with a foothold in the lucrative southern California market. (Prior to this time Kroger had no stores west of Kansas.) Kroger opened stores in Florida under the SupeRx and Florida Choice banners from the 1960s until 1988, when the chain decided to exit the state and sold all of its stores; Kash n' Karry bought the largest share. In the 1970s, Kroger became the first grocer in the United States to test an electronic scanner, and the first to formalize consumer research. Although Kroger has long operated stores in the Huntsville-Decatur area of northern Alabama (as a southern extension of its Nashville, Tennessee, region), it has not operated in the state's largest market, Birmingham, since the early 1970s, when it exited as a result of intense competition from Winn-Dixie and local chains Bruno's Supermarkets and Western Supermarkets. Kroger exited Milwaukee in 1972, selling a few stores to Jewel. Kroger would later return in 2015 upon its acquisition of Roundy's. Kroger entered the Charlotte market in 1977 and expanded rapidly throughout the 1980s when it bought some stores from BI-LO. However, most stores were in less desirable neighborhoods and did not fit in with Kroger's upscale image. Less than three months after BI-LO pulled out, that company decided to re-enter the Charlotte market, and in 1988 Kroger announced it would leave the Charlotte market and put its stores up for sale. Ahold bought Kroger's remaining stores in the Charlotte area. Kroger had a number of stores in the Western Pennsylvania region, encompassing Pittsburgh and surrounding areas from 1928 until 1984, when the U.S. began experiencing a severe economic recession. The recession had two significant and related effects on Kroger's operations in the region. First, the highly cyclical manufacturing-based economy of the region declined in greater proportion than the rest of the U.S., which undercut demand for the higher-end products and services offered by Kroger. The second effect of the economic recession was to worsen labor-management relations which led to a protracted labor strike in 1983 and 1984. During the strike, Kroger withdrew all of its stores from the Western Pennsylvania market, including some recently opened ""superstores"" and ""greenhouses,"" selling these stores to Wetterau (now part of SuperValu), who promptly flipped the stores to independent owners while continuing to supply them under the FoodLand and Shop 'n Save brands. Kroger's exit ceded the market to lower-cost, locally owned rivals, most notably Giant Eagle and the SuperValu-supplied grocers. (Kroger purchased Eagle Grocery company, whose founders went on to create Giant Eagle.) Kroger still maintains a presence in the nearby Morgantown, West Virginia, Wheeling, West Virginia, and Weirton, West Virginia/Steubenville, Ohio areas where Giant Eagle has a much smaller presence and the SuperValu-supplied stores are virtually nonexistent, though in all of these cases Walmart remains a major competitor and Aldi is the only other supermarket with any market overlap. Kroger entered the competitive San Antonio, Texas market in 1980 but pulled out in mid-1993. On June 15, 1993, the company announced it would close its 15 area stores 60 days later. The chain closed several stores around Flint, Michigan in 1981, which were converted by local businessman Al Kessel to a new chain called Kessel Food Markets. Kroger closed its northeastern Ohio stores in the Cleveland, Akron and Youngstown areas. Some of those former Kroger stores were taken over by stores like Acme Fresh Markets, Giant Eagle and Heinens. Kroger opened and had about 50 stores in St. Louis until it left the market in 1986, saying that its stores were unprofitable. Most of its stores were bought by National, Schnucks, and Shop 'n Save. Safeway (excluding the Randalls chain) exited the Houston market in early 1988. It sold many of its own properties to Kroger, the market leader in the region, which is still followed by Randalls (now owned by Safeway) today. Kroger also experienced a similar withdrawal from Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1989. Many of these stores were sold to the local grocery chain Red Food, which was in turn bought by BI-LO in 1994. Today, Chattanooga is the only metropolitan market in Tennessee in which Kroger does not operate. 1990s A regional Kroger in Fort Worth, Texas. It opened in 1997. (2014) In the 1990s, Kroger acquired Great Scott (Detroit), Pay Less Food Markets, Owen's Market, JayC Food Stores, and Hilander Foods. In 1997, Kroger merged with the then fifth-largest grocery company Fred Meyer, along with its subsidiaries, Ralphs, QFC, and Smith's. In the late 1990s, it acquired many stores from Super Fresh as it exited many markets in the South. Kroger also swapped all ten of its Greensboro, N.C.-area stores in 1999 to Matthews, N.C.-based Harris Teeter, for 11 of that company's stores in central and western Virginia. Kroger still maintains a North Carolina presence in the Raleigh-Durham area. In the Raleigh-Durham area, Kroger closed its North Raleigh store in the Wakefield Commons shopping center on July 9, 2011 because the location failed to meet sales expectations. After the closure, Kroger will operate 16 stores in the Triangle. Kroger had a store in Greenville from the 1980s until 2010 when it sold it to Harris Teeter. Long the dominant grocer in western Virginia, Kroger entered the Richmond, Virginia market in 2000, where it competes against market leaders Martin's (including former Ukrop's stores) and Food Lion. Kroger entered the market by purchasing Hannaford stores that either already existed or were being built in Richmond. Hannaford purchases also included the competitive Hampton Roads market, where it now competes with Farm Fresh, Harris Teeter, and Food Lion. In 2014, Kroger launched a new campaign called Fresh And Friendly, where every Kroger employee in retail should at least say hello in an attempt to gain a customer. On March 3, 2015, Kroger announced it will enter Hawaii, having registered with the state as a new business in February 2015. The move had been in the planning stages, as it was planning to expand there in 2006 but withdrew after it had already submitted registration. Kroger, who is in the process of looking for locations to open its first store (and have yet to whether to use another name for its store branding), will face competition from Honolulu-based rivals Foodland and Times, major retailers Safeway, Wal-Mart, and Costco, Japanese-owned Don Quixote, and Department of Defense-owned DeCA Commissaries. Two Harris Teeter stores were closed outright, and three closed temporarily while being converted to the Kroger brand (one of these will undergo a major remodel and replace a neighboring Kroger store).

Quik Stop (California, Nevada), Transitioned to Loaf 'N Jug brand. On October 5, 2006, a new Kroger Marketplace opened in Gahanna. With the Gahanna opening, the number of Kroger Marketplace stores is six, four in the Columbus area and two in the Cincinnati area. Two more stores were planned in 2007, one in Middletown (which opened in April 2007, after the old store was razed and made part of the current parking lot) and one in Englewood. Kroger opened a new 60,000&#160;sq&#160;ft (5,600&#160;m2) store in North Augusta, South Carolina. In 2015, a 145,000 square feet Marketplace was opened in the Cincinnati suburb of Oakley. The first Kroger Marketplace store in Tennessee opened in Farragut, Tennessee (a small suburb outside of Knoxville) at the end of 2008, and a second store in Thompson's Station, Tennessee, (about 20 miles (32&#160;km) south of Nashville) in early 2009. A third location opened in Gallatin, Tennessee, on March 11, 2010. The first Kroger Marketplace in Arkansas opened in August 2010 on Chenal Parkway in Little Rock, Arkansas. The first Kroger Marketplace in Virginia opened on Midlothian Turnpike in Richmond, Virginia, on the site of the former Cloverleaf Mall on December 6, 2012. In addition to stocking a variety of regional brand products, The Kroger Company also employs one of the largest networks of private label manufacturing in the country. Thirty-seven plants (either wholly owned or used with operating agreements) in seventeen states create about 40% of Kroger's private label products.

(September 2013) Kroger brand products are produced and sold in three quality tiers: Private Selection - premium quality brand Banner Brands (such as Kroger, Ralphs, King Soopers) - the majority of the 11,000 items stocked in stores Value brand - good quality at an affordable price P$$T..., Check This Out... and Heritage Farm Kroger Value Brand The P$$T…, Check This Out... and Heritage Farm line of products was introduced in 1981 by the name of Cost Cutter and was known for its near-generic product labeling. It was then succeeded by FMV, which was a backronym to mean For Maximum Value, originally meaning Fred Meyer Value. In early 2007, Kroger replaced FMV with the new Kroger Value brand. The Kroger Value name was phased out in 2014. It offers staple products such as sugar, flour, bread, and canned goods at the lowest price for that particular product in the store. Though some of these products (such as their cheese made with water and partially hydrogenated soybean oil) use a lower-quality manufacturing process, other products appear to be indistinguishable from their banner brand equivalent (P$$T… sugar and Kroger sugar, for example) other than the price. Kroger has expanded the line to many other items, such as bread, coffee, tea, ice cream, paper towels, bleach, dog and cat food, and other food and household items. Most Kroger Value brand items were bilingually labeled (in English and Spanish), however the new P$$T…, Check This Out... and Heritage Farm are not. Banner Brands Banner Brands, goods that bear the name of Kroger or its subsidiaries (i.e., Ralphs, King Soopers, etc.) or make reference to them (i.e., Big K) are offered with a ""Try it, Like it, or Get the National Brand Free"" guarantee, where if the customer does not believe the Kroger brand product is as good as the national brand, they can exchange the unused portion of the product with their receipt for the equivalent national brand for free. Many of Kroger's health and beauty goods, one of the company's fastest-growing private label categories, are manufactured by third-party providers; these products include goods like ibuprofen and contact lens solution. Private Selection As well as the major grocery brands, Kroger's manufacturing creates a variety of general merchandise brands. These are featured especially in Fred Meyer stores, where more than half the goods sold are non-food, or in the smaller Fred Meyer-based Marketplace stores. The following brands might be found in various Kroger-owned stores: Bread SuperKids - IronKids bread competitor Dairy Springdale - milk by the gallon Mountain Dairy - milk by the gallon (QFC, Fred Meyer, Smith's, Fry's and Ralphs) Sungold - sweet and unsweet gallon jug tea Thirst Rockers - imitation juice (water, high fructose corn syrup, 0% juice) Country Club - butter Deli Wholesome @ Home - new name to include all private label products(pizza, pasta, sides, etc.) Your Deli Selection - baked beans, coleslaw, potato salad Drug &amp; General Merchandise HD Designs – upscale home goods MotoTech – automotive supplies Office Works – stationery and office supplies Splash Sport, Splash Spa, and Bath &amp; Body Therapies – bath and body supplies Comforts For Baby - baby and infant supplies, diapers Frozen Food Country Club - real butter sticks, half-gallon ice cream/frozen yogurt (Discontinued in Scotts Food and Pharmacy stores) Old Fashioned - gallon tub ice cream/frozen yogurt Grocery and General Merchandise aromaFUSIONS - air freshener supplies, scented candles Big K - soda, cooler drinks, sparkling water Crystal Clear - flavored sparkling water Disney's Old Yeller - dry dog food Disney's Aristocats - wet cat food Everyday Living – kitchen gadgets &amp; cleaning supplies, furniture On the House - margarita and other drink mixes P$$T...Big Savings...Pass it On - bread Heritage Farms...Fresh Meat Check This Out - Non Food Items Pet Pride - dry dog and cat food, cat litter Tempo - laundry detergent and fabric softener Whole Health (Nutrition) Simple Truth – organic and natural foods Disney Magic Selections Most Kroger locations now feature Redbox movie rental kiosks. Previously, some Kroger locations featured kiosks from The New Release (aka Moviecube); most of these kiosks have since been replaced by Redbox kiosks. Also, until 2012, Kroger locations in the Columbus, Ohio area featured kiosks by Blockbuster Express (originally DVD Play). Distribution/Logistics i-wireless (Wireless services)"

(August 2009) Early history In 1912, Bella Cabakoff emigrated with her parents from Russia to Columbus, Ohio, to escape persecution. At age 21, she became the youngest buyer for the Lazarus department store chain. However, after spending over 20 years with Lazarus, in 1951 she and her husband Harry Wexner opened a women's clothing store named Leslie's (after their son) on State Street. This store became the training ground for Leslie ""Les"" Wexner. In 1963, he borrowed $5,000 from his aunt and $5,000 from the bank and opened a store at the Kingsdale Shopping Center in Upper Arlington, Ohio. This store was named ""The Limited"" because the store focused on clothing for younger women, unlike his parents' general merchandise store. Later in 1964, Bella and Harry closed their store to join their son in his venture. The original board consisted of only the three family members and longtime friend Jim Waldron, who served as Senior Vice President. Bella Wexner served as secretary until her death in 2001, Harry as chairman, who served until his death in 1975, and Leslie succeeded his father as the chairman and later became CEO. As of 2014 he and his family continue to own 17% of LB. In 1969, Wexner took The Limited Brands public on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1977, The Limited moved into its main headquarters on Morse Road in Columbus, from which it still operates today.

At National Health Laboratories, Inc. he grew annual sales of the company each year by 43%, with revenue reaching $12 million by the end of his tenure. Lillig then left to found several health-care companies, including Syscor, Inc., Intelysis, Inc., Asterion, LLC and MetaCyte's 3DR in Louisville, Kentucky. Revlon had been a publicly traded company since the 1950s, as it was during most of its ownership of National Health Laboratories. But in 1985, Revlon (now NYSE:&#160;REV) had been taken over by Ronald Perelman. Through early 1995, the National Health Laboratories principal executive offices were located at 4225 Executive Square, Suite 805 in La Jolla, California. On May 4, 1994, National Health Laboratories announced that it would acquire Allied Clinical Laboratories, Inc. (formerly NASDAQ:&#160;ACLB) of Nashville, Tennessee. In December 2001, LabCorp became the exclusive marketer for genomics and proteomics predictive cancer test products made by Myriad Genetics, Inc.

(January 2009) Leggett &amp; Platt Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;LEG S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Residential Bedding and Furniture Automotive Seating Industrial Materials Founded 1883 Headquarters Carthage, Missouri, USA Key people Karl G. Glassman, President &amp; CEO Revenue $3.9 billion USD (2015) Operating income $487 million USD (2015) Net income $325 million USD (2015) Number of employees 20,000 (2015) Slogan Enhancing people's lives for over 130 years. Website leggett.com Leggett &amp; Platt (L&amp;P), based in Carthage, Missouri, is a diversified manufacturer (and member of the S&amp;P 500 Index) that designs and produces engineered components and products that can be found in most homes and automobiles. The firm was founded in 1883, and consists of 17 business units, 20,000 employee-partners, and 130 manufacturing facilities located in 19 countries. Leggett &amp; Platt's inventive heritage and leadership in the residential furnishings industry spans over 130 years. Today, they are the leading worldwide supplier of a wide range of components (many of which are proprietary) that manufacturers of bedding and upholstered furniture use to make their finished products. Leggett &amp; Platt also produces and distributes carpet cushion for residential and commercial applications. In addition, they are a major distributor of geo components used in ground stabilization, drainage protection, erosion control, and weed control. J.P. Leggett C.B. Platt In 1883 in Carthage, Missouri, J.P. Leggett developed a new type of bedspring consisting of single cone spring wire coils, formed and interlaced, then mounted on a wood slat base. The bedspring could then be used as a base for the then-popular cotton, feather or horsehair mattresses. Needing expertise in manufacturing and production, he recruited his soon-to-be brother-in-law, C.B. Platt, whose father owned and operated Platt Plow Works, into the partnership. Together, they produced the components of their Leggett &amp; Platt bedspring, which was patented in 1885. Bedspring vs. Innerspring At the time of their invention, bedsprings referred to cone-shaped wire coiled springs, attached to a wooden slat foundation, used to support then-popular mattresses. These mattresses were typically made of horse hair, corn husks, cotton, feathers, or another soft material. Early bedsprings functioned similarly to today's box springs in their support of a mattress. However, box springs are rather rigid in structure, while bedsprings provide a more flexible surface. Innersprings, by contrast, refer to the core system of wire springs that, along with various types of foam and other padding materials, comprise the insides of today's mattress. The mattress is usually coupled with a box spring to create a sleep set. Innersprings can be coiled springs laced together, continuous coil springs, or individually encased springs, that support a person sleeping on the mattress. The Carthage market for their new product was very limited. To expand the market to a wider region, Mr. Platt and George Leggett, brother of J. P. Leggett, would load a horse-drawn wagon with bedsprings and travel to surrounding communities. Often, to conserve space, they would load the springs and slats separately into the wagon and assemble them in a store or on an adjacent sidewalk. The partnership prospered, and the business was incorporated in 1901. The Platt Plow Works The company built its first factory and offices in Carthage in 1895. The workforce at that time consisted of the two partners and five employees. Soon after completion of the Carthage plant, a second factory was built in Louisville, Kentucky. During the next 50 years, three more factories were built. Demand for the company’s improved bedsprings was rising, and a second plant was built in Carthage in 1925. The new, much larger plant was located next to a railroad to allow for expanded shipments of products and supplies. In 1942, an additional factory was built in Winchester, Kentucky, which was subsequently consolidated with the Louisville plant. For some time, Texas had proven to be a main market outlet, and in 1947, a major factory was built in Ennis, Texas. By 1947, Leggett &amp; Platt consisted of 4 plants and 500 employees. Although available in various models and continuously improved upon, bedsprings were practically the only product Leggett &amp; Platt offered until 1933. However, in that year the company began to manufacture springs for innerspring mattresses, which were relatively new products in the industry and growing in popularity. Thereafter, the company slowly began to diversify its products within the bedding industry by producing rollaway beds and folding metal cots, along with bed frames and bed rails. Innerspring mattress components In 1960, Harry M. Cornell Jr., J.P. Leggett’s grandson, was elected President and CEO of the company, taking over for his father (who was Mr. Leggett’s son-in-law). The company’s total sales in 1960 were approximately $7 million from three states – Kentucky, Texas and Missouri. Determining the course and future of the company became management’s primary objective. Following an extensive evaluation of the company and its potential, Mr. Cornell and his management partners concluded that Leggett &amp; Platt’s best opportunities for profitable growth lay in a strategy of specializing in manufacturing, marketing, and distributing a broad and growing line of components and related products, first nationally and eventually on a world-wide basis. Key drivers of future sales and earnings would include aggressive internal growth initiatives, coupled with an active and ongoing acquisition program. J.P. Leggett's original bedspring and patent Even greater success followed, and Leggett &amp; Platt became known as “the components people.” Leggett &amp; Platt stock was first traded over the counter in 1967. Twelve years later, on June 25, 1979, top management was present in New York City to witness the stock’s first day listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1985, Leggett &amp; Platt grew into the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S.-based manufacturing companies. In 1999, the company became part of the S&amp;P 500 Index. Today, Leggett &amp; Platt has 130 manufacturing facilities in 19 countries. Timeline 1883: Joseph P. Leggett develops and patents the first successful spiral steel coil bedspring, then forms a business partnership with Cornelius B. Platt, a blacksmith who operates the C.D. Platt Plow Works plant in Carthage, Missouri. 1885: Leggett receives a patent for improvements on the coiled bedspring. J.P. Leggett and C.B. Platt begin manufacturing coiled bedsprings at the Platt Plow Works plant. 1895: The first factory and offices are built in Carthage, MO. The workforce consists of the 2 partners and 5 employees. Harry Platt, a brother of C.B. Platt, opens a franchise factory in Louisville, Kentucky. 1901: The partnership of J.P. Leggett and C.B.

Gene Fisher was replaced by Leonard Miller when Leonard invested $10,000 into F&amp;R Builders. In 1971, F&amp;R Builders went public under the new name of Lennar, a combination of Leonard and Arnold. In 2003, Lennar's flagship community Coto de Caza, California in Orange County was completed. It's a census-designated place (CDP) and a guard-gated private community, and has around 4,000 homes and 5,000 acres (20&#160;km2). It started out as an inexpensive community, but it has blossomed into a sprawling affluent community, that now ranks among the wealthiest communities in all of the United States. It is no longer owned or controlled by Lennar, although Lennar Home has development rights on the last 1,000 acres (4.0&#160;km2) in Coto. This section requires expansion. (July 2008) In the words of the LA Times, ""for Lennar, closed military bases have become a cottage industry"". The company was chosen on 1997 as the master developer of this site. On 2002 the Navy transferred 650 acres (2.6&#160;km2) to the city of Vallejo, and then to Lennar Mare Island. Lennar stated that it would use those 650 acres (2.6&#160;km2) to build homes, shops, restaurants and businesses. The company got the land for free in exchange for investing $260 million in streets and utilities, historic preservation and building renovation. The Lennar Mare Island Reuse Plan includes 1,400 homes, roughly 7,000,000 square feet (650,000&#160;m2) of commercial and industrial space, and many recreational amenities.

The company is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange and is a member of the S&amp;P 500 stock index. Eli Lilly was one of the Nifty Fifty stocks that propelled the mid 20th century bull market. Eli Lilly is a full member of the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA). Lilly began formulating plans to create a medical wholesale company while working in partnership at the Binford and Lilly drug store in Illinois. Colonel Eli Lilly (1838–1898), founder Early days: 1870s–1900 As young boys, Lilly's grandsons, Eli and Josiah (Joe) ran errands and did other odd jobs. After college Eli and Joe joined the family business and eventually each one served as company president and chairman of the board. Josiah K. Lilly, Sr. (1861–1948), second company president. Modernization:1900–40 Expansion of Lilly's manufacturing facilities at the McCarty Street plant improved production capacity with a new Science Building (Building 14), opened in 1911, and a new capsule plant (Building 15) in 1913. The collaboration led to the first successful large-scale production of insulin. In 1923 Lilly began selling Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), their tradename for the first commercially available insulin product in the U.S for the treatment of diabetes. Eli Lilly (1885–1977), third company president. In 1934 the firm opened two new facilities on the McCarty Street complex: a replica of Lilly’s 1876 laboratory and the new Lilly Research Laboratories, ""one of the most fully equipped facilities in the world."" Eli Lilly, who had served as the company's president since 1932, retired from active management of the company in 1948, became chairman of the board, and relinquished the presidency to his brother, Josiah K. Lilly, Jr. (Joe). In 1953 Eugene N. Beesley was named the company's new president, the first non-family member to run the company. Over the next several decades Lilly continued to develop and introduce new drugs to the marketplace. In the 1950s Lilly introduced two new antibiotics: vancomycin and erythromycin. In addition Lilly was heavily involved in production and distribution of Jonas Salk's poliomyelitis (polio) vaccine. In 1954 the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) contracted with five pharmaceutical companies to produce Salk's polio vaccine for clinical trials. These included Lilly as well as Parke, Davis and Company, Cutter Laboratories, Wyeth Laboratories, and Pitman-Moore Company. Lilly sold companies in its Medical Device and Diagnostics Division, expanded international sales, made new acquisitions, and funded additional research and product development. Sidney Taurel, former chief operating officer of Lilly, was named CEO in 1998, replacing Tobias. Taurel was named chairman in January 1999. In 2000 Lilly reported $10.86 billion in net sales. Eli Lilly's present day global manufacturing plants. In 1998 Eli Lilly formed a joint venture with Icos Corporation (ICOS), a Bothell, Washington-based biotechnology company, to develop and commercialize Cialis, a product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. In October 2006 Lilly announced its intention to acquire Icos for $2.1 billion, or $32 per share. After its initial attempt to acquire Icos failed under pressure from large institutional shareholders, Lilly revised its offer to $34 per share. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), a proxy advisory firm, advised Icos shareholders to reject the proposal as undervalued, In December 2007 CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S (CMC), a Copenhagen, Denmark-based provider of contract biomanufacturing services, bought the Bothell-based biologics facility from Lilly and retained the existing 127 employees. The facility resides on a 52 acres (0.21&#160;km2) campus and is one of the largest biopharmaceutical manufacturing centers in the United States. The following is an illustration of the company's major mergers, acquisitions and historical predecessors: Eli Lilly and Company Eli Lilly and Company Eli Lilly and Company (Founded 1876) Distillers Company (Acq 1962) Elizabeth Arden, Inc.

Sold stake 1999) Elanco (Established 1954 as a division of Eli Lilly and Company) Collaborative research As part of its research and product development process Lilly also conducted clinical studies at Indianapolis City Hospital (Wishard Memorial Hospital). Lilly continues to conduct clinical studies to test medications before their introduction to the market. In 1949 Eli Lilly actually went into partnership with the United States Army Reserve setting up a local Strategic Intelligence Research and Analysis (SIRA)Unit to allow employees to research company data for the Scientific Logistics and Eurasian fields of study (source: declassified Defense Intelligence Agency document MDR -0191-2008 dated 17 Sep 2012). In 1998 the company dedicated new laboratories for clinical research at the Indiana University Medical Center in Indianapolis. Publicly funded research In 2008 this consortium, which included Lilly S.A. (Switzerland), secured a €8 million budget for a 40-month project that was coordinated by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), an organization who represents the research-based pharmaceutical industry and biotech companies operating in Europe. The company's most important products introduced prior to World War II included insulin, which Lilly marketed as Iletin (Insulin, Lilly), Amytal, Merthiolate, ephedrine, and liver extracts. Introduced in 1923, Iletin (Insulin, Lilly) was Lilly's first commercial insulin product. In 2002 the company was the leading producer of products for those with diabetes. During World War II Lilly produced penicillins and other antibiotics. In addition to penicillin, other wartime production included ""antimalarials,"" blood plasma, encephalitis vaccine, typhus and influenza vaccine, gas gangrene antitoxin, Merthiolate, and Iletin (Insulin, Lilly). Among the company's more recent pharmaceutical developments are cephalosporin, erythromycin, and Prozac (fluoxetine), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) for the treatment of clinical depression. Ceclor, introduced in the 1970s, was an oral cephalosporin antibiotic. Prozac, introduced in the 1980s, quickly became the company's best-selling product for treatment of depression, but Lilly lost its U.S. patent protection for this product in 2001. Among other distinctions, Lilly is the world's largest manufacturer and distributor of medications used in a broad range of psychiatric and mental health-related conditions, including clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, narcotic addiction, insomnia, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and others. Cialis Further information: Tadalafil In 2003, Eli Lilly introduced Cialis (tadalafil), a competitor to Pfizer's blockbuster Viagra for erectile dysfunction. Cialis maintains an active period of 36 hours, causing it sometimes to be dubbed the ""weekend pill"". Cialis was developed in a partnership with biotechnology company Icos Corporation. On December 18, 2006, Lilly bought Icos in order to gain full control of the product. Because of its wide appeal as a popular anti-depressant, references to Prozac have appeared in books, movies, and music. Prozac Nation (1994), an autobiographical book by Elizabeth Wurtzel, was turned into a film of the same name in 2001 and starred Christina Ricci. Listening to Prozac (1993), by Peter Kramer, was a generally analytical look at Prozac and its uses, not only to treat disorders but to diagnose them as well. Talking Back to Prozac (1994), by psychiatrist Peter Breggin, focuses on Prozac's side effects. Rapper Jay-Z referenced Prozac in the song, ""Nigga What, Nigga Who"" (1998). In HBO's fictional series, The Sopranos, Tony Soprano's use of Prozac is periodically referenced. Secobarbital gained considerable attention during the 1970s, when it gained wide popularity as a recreational drug. On September 18, 1970, rock guitarist legend Jimi Hendrix died from a secobarbital overdose. On June 22, 1969, secobarbital overdose was the cause of death of actress Judy Garland. The drug was a central part of the plot of the hugely popular novel Valley of the Dolls (1966) by Jacqueline Susann in which three highly successful Hollywood women each fall victim, in various ways, to the drug. The novel was later released as a film by the same name. Further information: Thiomersal Eli Lilly has developed the vaccine preservative thiomersal (also called merthiolate and thimerosal). Thiomersal is effective by causing susceptible bacteria to autolyze. Launched in 1930, merthiolate was a mercury-based antiseptic and germicide that ""had been formulated at the University of Maryland with support of a Lilly research fellowship."" congressional Republicans inserted a provision into a domestic security bill that President George W. Bush signed into a law, protecting Eli Lilly from all suits in the federal courts, alleging that the drug, Thiomersal caused autism and other neurological disorders in children, such that all such matters be heard by a special master appointed for the purpose, rather than regular federal courts. Its toxicology was that it metabolized into ethylmercury (C2H5Hg+) and thiosalicylate, in the body, which was immensely hazardous to developing countries like India. Alimta (for pleural mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer). Amytal (a ""barbituric acid derivative"" introduced in 1925 was ""the first American sedative of this kind""). Ceclor (an oral cephalosporin antibiotic). Darvocet (an analgesic for mild to moderate pain). Darvon, (an analgesic alternative to codeine, introduced in 1957 withdrawn in 2009). Effient (an antithrombotic for acute coronary syndrome in percutaneous coronary intervention); co-marketed with Daiichi Sankyo. Ephedrine (introduced in 1926 for the treatment of allergies, including hay fever and asthma). E-Mycin (an antibiotic for respiratory and other infections). Erbitux (for metastatic colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer). Evista (for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and for the reduction in risk of breast cancer). Forteo (for osteoporosis). Glucagon (for severe, life-threatening hypoglycemia). Humalog (for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes). Humatrope (a human growth hormone for pediatric growth disorders). Humulin (for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes). Keflex (a cephalosporin antibiotic). Livalo (for hypercholesterolemia). Moxam (an antibiotic. Introduced in collaboration with Shionogi, a Japanese drug company). Mandol (an injectable cephalosporin antibiotic for treating ""hospital-acquired infections""). ReoPro (a cardiovascular drug used during high-risk angioplasty surgery). Strattera (a non-stimulant medication for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder). Symbyax (for bipolar disorder). Tradjenta (for Type 2 diabetes). Xigris (for severe sepsis). Withdrawn in November 2011 after failure to show benefit. Zyprexa (for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) Released in 1996.

The two founders developed a conservative and flexible value-oriented philosophy which continues to be a cornerstone of Loews today. The Tisch brothers soon diversified the Loews business, successfully venturing into a variety of areas as the 1960s and 1970s progressed. Loews acquired Lorillard, a tobacco company, in 1968; CNA Financial in 1974, and the Bulova Watch Company in 1979. Through acquisitions, Loews' revenues grew from $100 million in 1970 to more than $3 billion by a decade later. Laurence Tisch briefly owned, through Loews, a significant portion of U.S. television and radio broadcaster CBS in the 1980s. As Chairman of CBS, he also approved the deal that brought late night host David Letterman to the network from NBC. In 2003, Loews purchased Texas Gas Transmission, LLC and, a year later, bought Gulf South Pipeline Company. These two companies were consolidated into a new entity, Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, which went public in 2005. Structured as a midstream master limited partnership (“MLP”), Boardwalk Pipeline provides transportation, storage, gathering and processing of natural gas and liquids for its customers. ^ a b c d e f LOEWS CORPORATION, Securities and Exchange Commission, February 24,2014 ^ Loews Company Overview March 2013 http://www.loews.com/; Winans, Christopher.

(January 2011) The first Lowe's store, Lowe's North Wilkesboro Hardware, was first opened in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina in 1921 by Lucius Smith Lowe (1879 - 1940), who had Baptist background. When Lowe died in 1940, the business was inherited by his daughter Ruth, who sold the company to her brother Jim that same year. Jim took on Carl Buchan as a partner in 1943. Under Buchan's management, the store focused on hardware and building materials. Before then, the product mix had also included notions, dry goods, horse tack, snuff, produce, and groceries. The company bought a second location in Sparta, North Carolina in 1949. Buchan and Lowe differed on expanding the company to new areas and they split in 1952 with Buchan (himself) taking control of the hardware and building supply business and Lowe taking other joint ventures the two controlled (including a car dealership). Buchan became the sole owner of Lowe's. In 1954, Lowe started the Lowes Foods grocery store chain. By 1955, Buchan quickly expanded by opening stores in the North Carolina cities of Asheville, Charlotte, and Durham. More stores opened through the 1950s. In 1960, Buchan died of a heart attack at the age of 44. His five-man executive team, which included Robert Strickland and Leonard Herring, took the company public in 1961. By 1962, Lowe's now operated 21 stores and reported annual revenues of $32&#160;million. Lowe's #487 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. A typical Lowe's storefront in Santa Clara, California. Interior in Orlando, Florida (2004) Headquarters United States The Lowe's corporate headquarters is located in Mooresville, North Carolina. The Mooresville facility, the newest Lowe's corporate campus, is 25 miles (40&#160;km) north of Charlotte and contains a five story, 400,000-square-foot (37,000&#160;m2) building along with two newer seven story buildings. The building has a central atrium and two office wings; the atrium houses a food court, a five story spiral staircase, and meeting and reception rooms. A 7-acre (2.8&#160;ha) lake flows underneath the headquarters building. Lowe's former corporate office is based in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. Lowe's still operates a few corporate functions from Wilkesboro. The building was formerly the Wilkes Mall until 1997 when Lowe's bought the entire property. Since then, the entire 440,000 square-foot campus has been remodeled numerous times, and features a fully gated campus, security gates and guards, cameras, a food court, meeting rooms and others. Lowe's is organized geographically into divisions in the U.S. (North, South, and West), Regions, Markets and then the individual store. Currently, Lowe's in Mexico &amp; Canada each stand alone within their own regions respectively. It is decentralized. A Lowe's store can have anywhere from 80 to over 400 employees depending on the size and sales volume. This article contains content that is written like an advertisement.

(December 2011) Lowe's won eight consecutive ENERGY STAR awards from 2003 to 2010, including four ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year awards for educating consumers about the benefits of energy efficiency. On March 1, 2010, Lowe's also became the first winner of the ENERGY STAR Sustained Excellence Award in Retail. Through this award, Lowe’s was recognized for its contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by promoting energy-efficient products and educating consumers and employees on the value of the Energy Star program. The tag line has been changed in September 2011 to 'Never Stop Improving'. After claims that it was avoiding using the term, Lowe's began using ""Christmas tree"" prominently in advertising. Lowe's advertising has been a part of the Christmas controversy in the United States. In 2005 Lowe's signage for their Christmas trees read ""holiday trees"" in English, but read árboles de Navidad (Christmas trees) in Spanish rather than árboles de feriados. The Lowe's sponsored team of Jimmie Johnson's pit box Lowe's purchased naming rights of Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina, in 1998, and the speedway changed names to Lowe's Motor Speedway. After the ten year naming rights expired, Lowe's extended naming rights by one year. After the one-year extension expired, Lowe's discontinued naming rights, and as of the 2010 racing season the racetrack returned to its original name. Lowe's is an associate sponsor of several Speedway Motorsports, Inc. properties such as Atlanta Motor Speedway and Bristol Motor Speedway. The corporation is the primary sponsor for 6-time NASCAR Sprint Cup champion Jimmie Johnson in the #48 Chevrolet SS and it was a part-time sponsor of the former #5 Nationwide Series car; both teams are owned by Hendrick Motorsports. Prior to the current sponsorship deal with Hendrick Motorsports, Lowe's was the sponsor of the #31 Chevrolet for Richard Childress Racing driven by Mike Skinner and Robby Gordon from 1997 to 2001. Prior to the RCR deal, Lowe's was the primary sponsor of the #11 Ford driven by Brett Bodine for Junior Johnson &amp; Associates and later his own team, Brett Bodine Racing (after Bodine bought the #11 from Johnson). One of the company's earliest forays into racing sponsorship was in 1979, when it sponsored the #2 Buick of the Rod Osterlund team in what was then known the NASCAR Winston Cup Grand National Series (now Sprint Cup), for the Talladega 500. The car was driven in that race by David Pearson, subbing for injured rookie Dale Earnhardt. Lowe's would continue with sporadic car sponsorship throughout the next two decades until the aforementioned Bodine sponsorship in 1995. Lowe's also sponsors Fernandez Racing in the American Le Mans Series and previously sponsored the team in the Rolex Sports Car Series; in that series, Lowe's sponsors the #99 Gainsco Stallings Racing Pontiac in events where Johnson is driving. All-American Muslim advertising Based in Toronto, Ontario, Lowe's opened its first three stores in Canada on December 10, 2007, in Hamilton, Brampton and Brantford. On February 1, 2008, they opened three more stores in Toronto, East Gwillimbury, and a second store in Brampton as well as a new location in Maple (Vaughan). Currently, additional stores are under construction, with 19 now open in the province of Ontario. Lowe's also recently announced expansion into Western Canada, starting with three new stores in Calgary, Alberta. One of the three locations opened in late September 2010. The other two opened in early 2011. There are now stores in British Columbia and Saskatchewan. To date (2013) Lowe's has 33 locations in Canada. Each store represents an average investment of $20.5&#160;million ($20.4&#160;million USD). In 2012, Lowe's attempted to buy Rona, Inc., a Quebec-based hardware chain; however, the deal was met with objections from Rona shareholders (particularly the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec) and operators of its franchised locations over concerns that the company could centralize its supply operations in the United States, and was eventually called off. Trading as Masters Home Improvement, the first store opened in Braybrook, Victoria to tradesmen on August 31, 2011 and the general public on September 1, 2011. Masters is a joint venture of the Lowe's Companies, Inc. and Woolworths Limited to compete against the Wesfarmers'-owned Bunnings Warehouse, which operates in the large bigbox format similar to Lowe's and Home Depot. The stores will be 1/3 owned by Lowe's Companies Inc. (USA) and 2/3 owned by Woolworths Limited (Australian Owned Public Company Listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX)).

(NYSE:&#160;LYB) is a public multinational chemical company with American and European roots, incorporated in the Netherlands, with U.S. operations headquarters based in Houston, Texas, and global operations in London, UK. It was formed in December 2007 by the acquisition of Lyondell Chemical Company by Basell Polyolefins for $12.7 billion. LyondellBasell was listed on the New York Stock Exchange on October 14, 2010. Lyondell was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (formerly NYSE:&#160;LYO) after the acquisition. LyondellBasell's United States operations filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2009 and emerged from bankruptcy in April 2010. On March 3, 2015 LyondellBasell filed an unfair labor charge with the National Labor Relations Board against the United Steelworkers as a national refinery strike stretched into its fifth week. The company alleged union members have threatened employees returning to work at facilities affected by the strike and have been using abusive language on social media sites., Lyondell Chemical Company was the third largest independent chemical manufacturer in the United States. Since its establishment in 1985 from facilities belonging to the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), the company grew through stock swaps with Occidental Chemicals and Millennium Chemicals in 1997 which formed Equistar Chemicals of which each entity were partners. Lyondell purchased the outstanding shares from each of its partners to gain total control of Equistar which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Lyondell. In 2004, Lyondell purchased Millennium Chemicals in a stock-swap deal at $2.3 billion. In August, 2006, Lyondell acquired Citgo's interest in the Lyondell-Citgo Refinery for $2.1 billion, and renamed the facility Houston Refining. Lyondell operates on five continents employing over 11,000 people. It is the global leader in propylene oxide production and the largest North American supplier of styrene monomer. Other products include ethylene, ETBE, polyethylene, and polypropylene. Chemical maker Basell Polyolefins purchased Lyondell in December 2007, creating the new company LyondellBasell Industries AF S.C.A. It was owned by Access Industries, a privately held, U.S.-based industrial group. LyondellBasell is the third largest independent chemical manufacturer in the world and is headquartered in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Sales in 2008 were $50.7 billion. The company has 60 manufacturing sites in 19 countries and 15,000 employees. In November 2009, Reliance Industries (controlled by Mukesh Ambani) bid $12 billion for LBI. In February 2010, Reliance raised its offer to $14.5 billion. Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) owns nearly one-third of LyondellBasell. The private equity firm invested $1.5 billion in the company when it restructured in 2010. Chief Executive Officer: Bhavesh V.

In 2003, M&amp;T Bank acquired Allfirst Bank of Baltimore, a subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks (NYSE:&#160;AIB) of Ireland. AIB formed Allfirst in 1999 by merging its newly acquired Dauphin Deposit Corp. in the state capital of Harrisburg, in Pennsylvania with two other recent properties: the old First National Bank of Maryland (later controlled by holding firm, First Maryland Bancorp) one of the top banks in Baltimore and Maryland, which it had acquired in 1997, and The York Bank of York, Pennsylvania. M&amp;T's acquisition went through the year after Allfirst in its brief life was found to have lost $691 million in the John Rusnak currency trading scandal. The acquisition was M&amp;T's largest, both in terms of assets acquired and as a percentage of M&amp;T's prior asset size. At the direction of Irish government financial regulators, AIB sold off its 22% ownership of M&amp;T in Autumn 2010.

(stylized as macy's, inc.) is an American holding company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. It is the owner of department store chains Macy's and Bloomingdale's, which specialize in the sales of clothing, footwear, accessories, bedding, furniture, jewelry, beauty products, and housewares; and Bluemercury, a chain of luxury beauty products stores and spas. As of July 26, 2015, the company operated approximately 885 stores in the United States, Guam, and Puerto Rico; its namesake locations and related operations account for 90 percent of its revenue. According to Deloitte, Macy's, Inc. is the world's largest fashion goods retailer and the 36th largest retailer overall, based on the company's reported 2010 retail sales revenue of $25 billion (equivalent to $27.1&#160;billion in 2016). Federated Department Stores was founded in Columbus, Ohio in 1929 as a department store holding company for Abraham &amp; Straus, F&amp;R Lazarus &amp; Company (including its Cincinnati division, then known as Shillito's) and William Filene's Sons of Boston; Founded by Xavier Warren Federated was the successor to the Lazarus operation begun in Columbus in 1851. In the mid-1930s, a modern merchandising standard was set when Fred Lazarus Jr. arranged garments in groups of a single size with a range of style, color and price in that size, basing the technique upon observations made in Paris. Fred Lazarus Jr. also convinced President Franklin D. Roosevelt that changing the Thanksgiving holiday from the last Thursday of November to the fourth Thursday, extending the Christmas shopping season, would benefit the nation's business; an act of Congress perpetuated the arrangement in 1941. After this date Black Friday became a nationwide sensation and the most profitable day for Federated. Other companies tried to follow suit but failed to achieve what John Albert Macy had in mind. Various Lazarus family members also held key positions on Federated's board and within its various divisions—namely, Foley's, Filene's, Lazarus and Shillito's. Robert Lazarus Jr. was the only family member still with an official role at Federated until his death in 2013, serving as assistant to Ron Klein, then chairman and CEO of the Rich's/Lazarus/Goldsmith's operating unit. Federated's corporate offices were relocated to Cincinnati in 1945. The later half of the 20th century saw the company expand nationwide, adding Rike Kumler of Dayton, Ohio (merged into Shillito's in the 1980s to become Shillito-Rike's); Burdines of Miami, Florida; Rich's of Atlanta, Georgia; Foley's of Houston, Texas; Sanger Brothers and A. Harris, both of Dallas, Texas (which was merged with Sanger Brothers to form Sanger-Harris); Boston Store of Milwaukee, Wisconsin; MainStreet of Chicago, Illinois; Bullock's, of Los Angeles; I. Magnin, of San Francisco, California; Gold Circle; and Richway Discount Department Stores of Worthington, Ohio. In 1982, Federated acquired the Twin Fair, Inc. discount store chain based in Buffalo, New York and merged it with Gold Circle. In 1983, it sold most of its infrastructure to JMB Realty. Former F&amp;R Lazarus &amp; Company flagship store in Downtown Columbus; Original headquarters of Federated/Macy's, Inc. To support its huge retail operations, Federated centralized its back-office functions into several large divisions, covering financial services, marketing, merchandising, logistics, and data processing systems. Other retailers' branded credit cards are usually issued and serviced by a third-party bank; Federated was so huge that it ran its own private bank, FDS Bank, which for many years issued and maintained the majority of its own consumer credit card portfolio with a portion at one time owned by General Electric Credit Corporation, an arrangement inherited from when R.H. Macy &amp; Company sold their credit portfolio in an attempt to prevent filing for bankruptcy. In 2005 Federated finalized an arrangement with Citigroup to sell its consumer credit portfolio, reissuing its cards under the Federated-CitiGroup Alliance name Department Stores National Bank (DSNB) and allowing Federated to continue servicing the credit accounts from its Financial, Administrative and Credit Services Group (Macy's Credit and Customer Services) In 1990, Federated—now under the control of Robert Campeau—went bankrupt after its hostile takeover of Allied Stores; it emerged from bankruptcy after the ouster of Campeau in 1992 as a new public company. Federated then took over Macy's in 1994 while that company was still emerging from its own bankruptcy in 1992. Federated entered e-commerce late, in 1998. FDS Bank was one of the last credit card banks to begin to allow its cardholders to access account information online (around 2004). The department store chain Stern's, a division of Federated, ceased operations in 2001 and most of its stores became Macy's stores. In 2003, Federated changed the nameplates of all their non-Macy's stores, except Bloomingdale's, to include the Macy's name. The rebranding process was referred internally to as Project Hyphen. Under the plan, Seattle-based The Bon Marché became Bon-Macy's; Goldsmith's in Tennessee became Goldsmith's-Macy's; Lazarus, Burdines, and Rich's also added ""-Macy's"" to their name. A year later, the original hyphenated names were dropped in favor of just Macy's, a rebranding process referred internally to as Project Star. Federated settled an SEC investigation for $14.46 million (equivalent to $21&#160;million in 2016) in 1998 due to unethical debt-collection practices. Federated routinely forced credit card holders/debtors to sign an agreement that legally bound them to repay their outstanding balances instead of having the unsecured debt discharge via the filing of bankruptcy. Federated failed to file reaffirmation agreements with bankruptcy courts. As a result, the changes in the agreements were not legally binding. The former Federated Department Stores logo, in use until 2005. On July 18, 2005, Federated Department Stores announced that it would acquire May Department Stores company for $11 billion (equivalent to $13.3&#160;billion in 2016) in cash and stock. Also part of the buyout was the bridal and formal unit of May, consisting of David's Bridal and After Hours Formalwear. Federated would also assume $6 billion (equivalent to $7.27&#160;billion in 2016) of May's debt, bringing total consideration to $17 billion (equivalent to $20.6&#160;billion in 2016). The deal would create the nation's largest department store chain with over 1,000 stores and $30 billion (equivalent to $36.3&#160;billion in 2016) in annual sales. To help finance the deal, Federated agreed to sell its combined proprietary credit card business (but still administered by FACS Group, a subsidiary of Federated) to Citigroup. The merger was completed on August 30, 2005, after an assurance agreement was reached with the State Attorneys General of New York, California, Massachusetts, Maryland and Pennsylvania. Federated announced plans to sell 80 store locations in 2006, having pledged in its settlement to sell most of them as viable businesses, with preference being given to a group of thirteen competitors. This number could fluctuate pursuant to Federated's negotiations with various mall landlords and its final decision regarding using former Macy locations for its luxury Bloomingdale's operation. On January 12, 2006, Federated announced its plans to divest May Company's Lord &amp; Taylor division (48 stores in 12 states) by the end of 2006 after utilizing prime and conflicting real estate by closing and converting several locations. On June 22, 2006, Macy's announced that NRDC Equity Partners, LLC would purchase Lord &amp; Taylor for US$1.2 billion (equivalent to $1.41&#160;billion in 2016), and completed the sale in October 2006. On September 9, 2006, May Company division stores Famous-Barr, Filene's, Foley's, Kaufmann's, Hecht's, The Jones Store, L. S. Ayres, Marshall Field's, Meier &amp; Frank, Robinsons-May, and Strawbridge's brands ceased to exist as Federated replaced most of them with the Macy's masthead, and a few converting to the Bloomingdale's brand. The conversion of Marshall Field's in Chicago has been particularly criticized, with many customers boycotting its historic State Street flagship store. The Chicago Tribune continues to report on the poor reception of Macy's in Chicago. Pittsburgh customers strongly resisted the change from Kauffman's most due to the local parade that the store had run for years. The loss of local mainstays, such as Famous-Barr in St. Louis and Filene's in Boston, were also met with criticism, but they were not nearly as vocal as Marshall Field's. One of the consequences of this rebranding is that several malls have two Macy's stores. In Downtown Boston, Federated liquidated an acquired Filene's because it already had a Macy's (formerly a Jordan Marsh) across the street. The two stores have a combined floorspace of more than 1,400,000 square feet (130,000&#160;m2), more than two-thirds the size of Macy's New York City flagship store. On November 17, 2006, the bridal and formal unit was sold. David's Bridal and Priscilla of Boston were sold to Leonard Green &amp; Partners. After Hours Formalwear was sold to Men's Wearhouse. On Wednesday, February 6, 2008, Terry Lundgren announced the localization strategy and the company's plan to shed 2,550 jobs. This new localization strategy is known as ""My Macy's."" Employees of the Macy's North headquarters office in Minneapolis, the Macy's Northwest headquarters office in Seattle, and the Macy's Midwest headquarters office in St. Louis were given pink slips, as Macy's pared its seven regional centers to four. About 40 new jobs were to be created in May as part of the restructuring. By 2009, the company expected to save $100 million (equivalent to $110&#160;million in 2016) a year from the cuts. On February 2, 2009 Macy's announced reduction of 7,000 jobs, or 4 percent of its work force, and slash its dividend as it looked to lower expenses as part of major restructuring. Cincinnati-based Macy's Inc. said the work force reduction includes positions in offices, stores and other locations. The cuts will include some unfilled jobs. ""Reducing our workforce is an unfortunate outcome of the current economic environment, and I am frustrated that so many of our people will be unable to move forward with us as we proceed into a very exciting future for Macy’s and Bloomingdale's"" said Terry J. Lundgren, chairman, president and chief executive officer. "" Macy's also got rid of its division structure and integrated its functions into one organization. Macy's central buying, merchandise planning, stores senior management and marketing functions merged to its New York corporate office (formerly Macy's East). Corporate-related business functions, such as finance and human resources, will be primarily in Cincinnati. To buy with local consumers in mind, Macy's developed a concept called ""My Macy's"", in which the buyers and planners all look at what the local consumer base is looking for in their local Macy's store. This will help bring a better sense of branding, sizing, and marketing to each Macy's store nationwide. Macy's Inc. decided to close the Bloomingdale's at the Mall of America in Minnesota. Since 1994, Bloomingdale's had been one of the 4 anchor stores of the mall, and will be replaced with a $30 million renovation with four new foreign clothing stores. On October 14, 2013, Macy's Inc. announced the decision to open most of their stores for the first time on Thanksgiving Day 2013, breaking a long-standing tradition of 155 years, and joined the ranks of retailers who created Gray Thursday the year before. Its doors opened at 8 p.m. (local time) on the holiday evening, and remained open for 24 hours straight until the close of business on Friday, which is usually about 10 p.m. Store name Years of operation Years under Macy's Inc.

Uranium purified by Mallinckrodt was used at the University of Chicago Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear chain reaction. Mallinckrodt also contributed uranium to the Manhattan Project, producing fissionables used in the atomic weapons detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. From 1942 to 1957 Mallinckrodt purified 50,000 short tons (45,000,000&#160;kg) of uranium products at various locations in and around the city of St. Louis. Cleanup sites include the St. Louis Downtown Site (SLDS), where uranium was refined; the St. Louis Airport Site (SLAPS), where waste produced at SLDS was stored; the Hazelwood Interim Storage Site (HISS), where waste from SLAPS was improperly relocated; and the St. Louis Airport Site Vicinity Properties (SLAPS VPs), areas where contamination was caused by relocation of waste. Additional nuclear waste was also illegally deposited at the West Lake Landfill, which has now been designated a Superfund site. Various buildings have been decontaminated and demolished and nuclear material has been excavated and shipped out of St. Louis by covered rail as part of the cleanup process, yet more nuclear waste remains in and around St. Louis. Recent history 1982 – Avon Products, Inc. acquires Mallinckrodt 1986 – International Minerals and Chemical Corporation (IMCERA Group Inc.) acquires Mallinckrodt from Avon 1995 – Mallinckrodt establishes generic pharmaceuticals business 1996 – Mallinckrodt Inc. acquires maker of urology imaging systems and injectors, Liebel-Flarsheim Co. Specialty Pharmaceuticals products include branded drugs as well as specialty generics and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Products include biologics, medicinal opioids, synthetic controlled substances, and acetominophen. Medical Imaging products include contrast media and radiopharmaceuticals for medical imaging applications. In the fourth quarter of 2014, Specialty Pharmaceuticals accounted for 74% of net sales. Key specialty pharmaceutical products include Hydrocodone API and tablets Oxycodone API and tablets Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended release tablets Dextroamphetamine sulfate controlled release tablets Other controlled substances, including acetominophen-containing products Medical Imaging products include Optiray (ioversol injection), an iodide based contrast medium for CT scans, and Optimark (gadoversetamide injection) a Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agent used in magnetic resonance imaging of the brain or liver.

Libya accounts for 235&#160;million barrels of oil equivalent (1.44×109&#160;GJ) of estimated proved reserves, although the company did not sell any product from these operations in 2015 since operations were interrupted by civil and political unrest.

In late 2003, Marathon Oil and its partners Noble Energy and AMPCO started the Bioko Island Malaria Control Project (BIMCP) in Equatorial Guinea. Malaria control activities included indoor residual spraying, improved diagnosis and case management, and capacity building to contain future outbreaks. BIMCP had proven being successful in reducing malaria transmission, reducing the proportion of children with malaria parasites, and improving iron status. BIMCP is perceived as a model of hands-on corporate involvement in a humanitarian effort with government, non-profits and academic organizations to reduce the burden of malaria in countries located in Equatorial Africa.  In June 2014, Marathon Oil Norge AS (“Marathon Norway"") was acquired by Det Norske Oljeselskap ASA for USD 2.1 billon."

Included in the deal were 18 Exxon stations in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, significantly boosting Marathon's presence in the Pittsburgh market, where former parent company U.S. Steel is based.

Headquarters Bethesda, Maryland, U.S. Area served Worldwide Key people Bill Marriott (Executive Chairman) Arne Sorenson (President and CEO) Products Hotels, resorts Revenue US$ 12.784 billion (2013) Net income US$ 626 million (2013) Number of employees 199,929 (July 2013) Subsidiaries Marriott Hotels &amp; Resorts Website marriott.com Marriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:&#160;MAR) is an American diversified hospitality company that manages and franchises a broad portfolio of hotels and related lodging facilities. Founded by J. Willard Marriott, the company is now led by his son, Executive Chairman Bill Marriott and President and Chief Executive Officer Arne Sorenson. Marriott International, headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, has more than 4,087 properties in over 80 countries and territories around the world, over 697,000 rooms (as of July 2014), and additional 195,000 rooms in the development pipeline. Their son, J.W. (Bill) Marriott, Jr., led the company to spectacular worldwide growth during his more than 50-year career. In March 2012, at age 80, he turned the CEO responsibilities over to Arne Sorenson, while he assumed the title of Executive Chairman. Marriott International was formed in 1993 when Marriott Corporation split into two companies, Marriott International and Host Marriott Corporation. In 1995, Marriott was the first hotel company worldwide to offer guests the option to book reservations online, via the company's implementation of MARSHA (Marriott's Automatic Reservation System for Hotel Accommodations). Marriott International believed that it could increase sales and profit margins for The Ritz-Carlton, a troubled chain with a significant number of properties either losing money or barely breaking even. The cost of Marriott's initial investment was estimated to be about $200 million in cash and assumed debt. The next year, Marriott spent $331 million to take over The Ritz-Carlton, Atlanta and buy a majority interest in two properties owned by William Johnson, a real estate developer who had purchased The Ritz-Carlton, Boston in 1983 and expanded his The Ritz-Carlton holdings over the next twenty years. The Ritz-Carlton began expansion into the lucrative timeshare market among other new initiatives made financially possible by the deep pockets of Marriott, which also lent its own in-house expertise in certain areas. There were other benefits for The Ritz-Carlton flowing from its relationship with Marriott, such as being able to take advantage of the parent company's reservation system and buying power. The partnership was solidified in 1998 when Marriott acquired a majority ownership of The Ritz-Carlton. Today, there are 81 The Ritz-Carlton properties around the world. The Marriott World Trade Center was destroyed during the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 2002 Marriott International began a major restructuring by spinning off many Senior Living Services Communities (which is now part of Sunrise Senior Living) and Marriott Distribution Services, so that it could focus on hotel ownership and management. The changes were completed in 2003. In February, 2012, Bloomberg reported on Romney's years overseeing tax matters for Marriott, which had included several ""scams"" (quoting Sen. John McCain) and legal actions brought against Marriott, which Marriott lost in court, over its manipulations of the tax code.) charged to convention-goers at a time when the $2.25 billion annually in ever-increasing ""incidental fees"" charged by US-based hotels to their lodgers was already drawing criticism and negative media coverage. Gaylord Hotels Marriott Vacation Club (MVC) JW Marriott Desert Springs in-door Boat Parking Foyer Select-service lodging Marriott also developed three and ultimately opened two theme parks entitled Marriott's Great America from 1976 until 1984. The parks were located in Gurnee, Illinois; Santa Clara, California; and a proposed but never-built location in the Washington, DC area, and were themed celebrating American history. The American-themed areas under Marriott's tenure of ownership included ""Carousel Plaza"" (the first section beyond the main gates); small-town-themed ""Hometown Square""; ""The Great Midwest Livestock Exposition At County Fair"" with a Turn of the Century rural-fair theme; ""Yankee Harbor"", inspired by a 19th-century New England port; ""Yukon Territory,"" resembling a Canadian/Alaskan logging camp; and the French Quarter-modeled ""Orleans Place"". At opening, both parks were laid out nearly identically. In 1984, Marriott disposed of its theme park division; both parks were sold and today are associated with national theme park chains. The Gurnee location was sold to Six Flags Theme Parks where it operates today as Six Flags Great America. The Santa Clara location was sold to the City of Santa Clara, who retained the underlying property and sold the park to Kings Entertainment Company, renamed Paramount Parks in 1993. From 1993 to 2006, the Santa Clara location was known as Paramount's Great America. In 2006, Paramount Parks was acquired by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company; the Santa Clara park operates today as California's Great America. In the years after their sale, the layouts of the parks have diverged substantially. Programs ^ ""100 Best Companies to Work For 2014 – Marriott International – Fortune"".

Masco_Corp.," Masco Corporation Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;MAS S&amp;P 500 Component Founded 1929 Founder Alex Manoogian Headquarters Taylor, Michigan, U.S. Key people Richard Manoogian (Chairman Emeritus) Keith J. Allman (President and Chief Executive Officer) Number of employees 32,500 Website http://www.masco.com/ Home improvement portal Masco Headquarters, Taylor, Michigan Masco Corporation is a manufacturer of products for the home improvement and new home construction markets. Masco is also a provider of a variety of installed products and services, including insulation for homebuilders. Comprising more than 20 companies, the Masco conglomerate operates nearly 60 manufacturing facilities in the United States and over 20 in other parts of the world. Since 1969 it trades on the NYSE. This was the last year that the company would be referred to as Masco Screw Products Company. Alex Manoogian, founder, acted as President and Chief Operating Officer (COO) from 1929 until 1967. In 1958 his son Richard joined the company. Richard, having spent nine years with the company, succeeded his father one year after the company moved to Taylor, Michigan. Alex died on July 10, 1996, the same year that his son Richard passed on his COO role to Ray Kennedy, allowing him to assume the position of Chief Executive Officer. In response to Kennedy’s death, Alan Barry was appointed as Masco’s President and COO on April 8, 2003. In 1985, Masco purchased the remaining outstanding stock of Flint &amp; Walling, Inc (after purchasing 30% in 1971 and controlling interest in 1978). In 1986, Masco started a home furnishings division by buying Henredon for $298 million and Drexel Heritage for $356 million. Other companies added to the division were Lexington Home Brands, Hickorycraft, Marge Carson, La Barge and Marbro in 1987, and fabric company Robert Allen/Ametex in 1988. In 1989, Universal Furniture, BenchCraft and Cal-Style were added in a $480 million deal, as well as Sunbury Textiles. The division added Berkline in 1994 and sold Marge Carson and Cal-Style in 1995. Masco reorganized its numerous companies; in 1988, the specialty products divisions of Masco Industries and Masco Corporation combined to form TriMas Corporation. Three years after this merger, TriMas was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The remainder of Masco Industries became Masco Tech Inc. and in 1993 was listed on the NYSE. At that point in time three different Masco Companies existed: Masco Corp., Masco Tech., and TriMas Corp. Two years later, Masco entered the services business. TriMas and Masco Tech merged to form one company offering a wide array of products. Masco announced a 2 for 1 stock split, which was the ninth time the Company had split its shares since 1960 and was the 40th year in a row that its dividends were increased. This merger left two companies, Masco Tech. and Masco Corp. Ginger Hot Spring Spas Masco Canada Ltd.

MasterCard logo used since 16 December 2006. It is not used on the cards themselves. Logo of Maestro, a debit card subsidiary, with a similar design to the MasterCard logo. Logo of Cirrus, the interbank network subsidiary, with a similar design to the MasterCard logo. The original banks behind MasterCard were United California Bank (later First Interstate Bank and subsequently merged into Wells Fargo Bank), Wells Fargo, Crocker National Bank (also subsequently merged into Wells Fargo), and the Bank of California (subsequently merged into the Union Bank of California). Robert Leavelle, Senior Vice President of Farmer's &amp; Merchants Bank of Long Beach, California, along with his son Martin Leavelle, created the graphic image based on the two overlapping circles with the Master Charge title overlaid in the center of the logo. This was part of an effort by The Independent Banker's Association. In 1966, the aforementioned group of California banks formed the Interbank Card Association (ICA). With the help of New York's Marine Midland Bank, now HSBC Bank USA, these banks joined with the ICA to create ""Master Charge: The Interbank Card"". The card was given a significant boost in 1969, when First National City Bank joined, merging its proprietary Everything Card with Master Charge. In 1968, MasterCard International and Eurocard started a strategic alliance, which effectively allowed MasterCard access to the European market, and for Eurocard to be accepted on the MasterCard network. The Access card system from the United Kingdom joined the MasterCard/Eurocard alliance in 1972. In 1979, ""Master Charge: The Interbank Card"" was renamed simply ""MasterCard"". In the early 1990s MasterCard then bought the British Access card and the Access name was dropped. In 2002, MasterCard International merged with Europay International SA, another large credit-card issuer association, which for many years issued cards under the name Eurocard (payment card). In 2006, MasterCard International underwent another name change to MasterCard Worldwide. This was done in order to suggest a more global scale of operations. In addition, the company introduced a new corporate logo adding a third circle to the two that had been used in the past (the familiar card logo, resembling a Venn diagram, remains unchanged). A new corporate tagline was introduced at the same time: ""The Heart of Commerce"". In October 2010, Visa and MasterCard reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in another antitrust case. The companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline certain types of cards (because interchange fees differ), or to offer consumers discounts for using cheaper cards. The settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a 10 basis-point reduction (0.1 percent) of swipe fees charged to merchants for a period of eight months. This eight-month period would probably begin in the middle of 2013. The total value of the settlement will be about $7.25 billion. In December 2010, a senior official from the European Central Bank called for a break-up of the Visa/MasterCard duopoly by creation of a new European debit card for use in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). The European Commission said that their investigation also includes large differences in fees across national borders. For instance, a 50-euro payment might cost 10 euro cents in the Netherlands but eight times that amount in Poland. The Commission argues that MasterCard rules that prohibit merchants from enjoying better terms offered in other EU countries may be against anti-trust law. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) praised the action against MasterCard. BEUC said interbank fees push up prices and hurt consumers. BEUC Director General Monique Goyens said, """"So in the end, all consumers are hit by a scheme which ultimately rewards the card company and issuing bank.""  on pain of daily fines to the amount of ISK 800,000 (some $6000) for each day after that time, to open the payment gateway. Valitor also had to pay DataCell's litigation costs of ISK 1,500,000. MasterCard, Comerica Bank, and the U.S. Treasury Department teamed up in 2008 to create the Direct Express Debit MasterCard prepaid debit card. The federal government uses the Express Debit product to issue electronic payments to people who do not have bank accounts, who are often referred to collectively as the “unbanked”. Comerica Bank is the issuing bank for the debit card. The Direct Express cards give recipients a number of consumer protections. In June 2013, MasterCard announced a partnership with British Airways to offer members the Executive Club Multi-currency Cash Passport, which will allow members to earn extra points and make multi-currency payments. The Passport card allows users to load up to seven currencies (euro, pound, U.S. dollar, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, New Zealand dollar and South African rand) at a locked-in rate. When used, the card selects the local currency to ensure the best exchange rate, and if the local currency is not already loaded onto the card, funds are used from other currencies. Actor Billy Crudup has been the voice in the US market; in the UK, actor Jack Davenport is the voice. The original idea and concept of the campaign stems from the advertising agency of McCann Erickson (as it was named in 1997). contending that MasterCard views such parodies as a violation of its rights under the federal and state trademark and unfair competition laws, under the federal and state anti-dilution laws, and under the Copyright Act. Despite these claims, however, noted US consumer advocate and presidential candidate Ralph Nader emerged victorious (after a four-year battle) in the suit MasterCard brought against him after he produced his own ""Priceless"" political commercials.) is an EMV compatible, ""contactless"" payment feature similar to American Express' ExpressPay, and Visa payWave. All three use the same symbol as shown on the right. It is based on the ISO/IEC 14443 standard that provides cardholders with a simpler way to pay by tapping a payment card or other payment device, such as a phone or key fob, on a point-of-sale terminal reader rather than swiping or inserting a card. PayPass can currently be used on transactions up to and including £20 GBP, $50 USD, $100 CAD, 200kr NOK, or $100 AUD. In 2003, MasterCard concluded a nine-month PayPass market trial in Orlando, Florida with JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, and MBNA. More than 16,000 cardholders and more than 60 retailer locations participated in the market trial. The order is dispatched to a nearby concession stand, from where a runner delivers the items to the patrons' seats. It is already deployed in Australian movie theaters and is being tested in Yankee Stadium. QkR is being marketed to vendors as a replacement for other mobile payment apps and a mobile ordering app, either distributed by the vendor (such as Starbucks's app, McDonalds' app, or Chipotle's mobile ordering app) or by a third party, such as Square, headed by Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey.

Its brands include McCormick; Zatarain's, Lawry's, Old Bay Seasoning, Mojave Foods, Thai Kitchen and Simply Asia (United States); Ducros, Drogheria &amp; Alimentari, Kamis, Margao, Silvo, and Vahine (Europe); Club House spices and Billy Bee Honey (Canada); Schwartz (United Kingdom); Aeroplane Jelly and Keen's Mustard (McCormick Foods Australia). Contents 1 History 2 Business units 3 References 4 External links History McCormick continued to use the Schilling name for its Western division until the 1990s. The last product containers marked Schilling were produced in 2002. Ben-Hur Products, a similar California-based company, was acquired in 1953, and Canada's largest spice firm, Gorman Eckert &amp; Co. Ltd. of London, Ontario, was acquired in 1959. Gilroy Foods of Gilroy, California became a wholly owned subsidiary in 1961. Other acquisitions included Baker Extract Co. in 1962, Cake Mate cake decorating in 1967, Childers Foods (later part of Golden West Foods) in 1968, and Tubed Products, an Easthampton, Massachusetts contract food packer and producer of plastic tubes, also in 1968. Charles P. McCormick retired in 1969 and was named Chairman Emeritus. He died of a heart attack in 1970. McCormick acquired Golden West Foods, a frozen foods manufacturer and distributor in Gilroy, California, in 1973 and entered that field under the Schilling brand label. The McCormick (east) and Schilling (west) retail units were consolidated to form a Grocery Products Division in 1975 with its headquarters in Baltimore. Additional acquisitions included All Portions in 1975, TV Time Foods of Chicago in 1976, Astro Foods of San Rafael, California in 1977, and Han-Dee Pak of Atlanta in 1979. In October 1979, Swiss pharmaceutical firm, Sandoz, Ltd., announced its intention of purchasing the company. The company acquired Ducros of France in 2000, later renamed McCormick France. In 2003, McCormick was added to the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index; acquired UniqSauces of the UK and Zatarain's of Louisiana; and sold its packaging businesses, Setco and Tubed Products, as well as its Jenks brokerage business assets. The company acquired C.M. van Sillevoldt B.V. of the Netherlands in 2004 and Epicurean International (renamed Simply Asia Foods) in 2006, with its Thai Kitchen and Simply Asia brands. In 2007, the company started a new advertising campaign to encourage people to dispose of older packages of spices, by pointing out that any of their packages that list their address as ""Baltimore, MD 21202"" are over 15 years old. In 2008, McCormick acquired Billy Bee Honey Products of Canada, and the Lawry's brand of seasonings and marinades (the biggest acquisition in company history). In mid-2013, the company completed its acquisition of Wuhan Asia-Pacific Condiments Co. Ltd. (WAPC), a seasoning manufacturer in the central region of China with the Daqiao and ChuShiLe buillon products. ^ http://www.mccormickcorporation.com/Our-Company/Leadership ^ a b c d e f g h ""MCCORMICK &amp; CO INC 2013 Annual Report Form (10-K)"" (XBRL).

It still exists at some restaurants. The oldest operating McDonald's restaurant was the fourth one built, opening in 1953. It is located at 10207 Lakewood Blvd. at Florence Ave. in Downey, California (at 33°56′50″N 118°07′06″W﻿ / ﻿33.9471°N 118.1182°W﻿ / 33.9471; -118.1182). Main article: History of McDonald's The business began in 1940, with a restaurant opened by brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald at 1398 North E Street at West 14th Street in San Bernardino, California (at 34°07′32″N 117°17′41″W﻿ / ﻿34.1255°N 117.2946°W﻿ / 34.1255; -117.2946). Their introduction of the ""Speedee Service System"" in 1948 furthered the principles of the modern fast-food restaurant that the White Castle hamburger chain had already put into practice more than two decades earlier. The first McDonalds with the arches opened in Phoenix in March 1953. The original mascot of McDonald's was a man with a chef's hat on top of a hamburger-shaped head whose name was ""Speedee"". By 1967, Speedee was eventually replaced with Ronald McDonald when the company first filed a U.S. trademark on a clown-shaped man having puffed-out costume legs. On May 4, 1961, McDonald's first filed for a U.S. trademark on the name ""McDonald's"" with the description ""Drive-In Restaurant Services"", which continues to be renewed through the end of December 2009. On September 13 that same year, the company filed a logo trademark on an overlapping, double-arched ""M"" symbol. By September 6, 1962, this M-symbol was temporarily disfavored, when a trademark was filed for a single arch, shaped over many of the early McDonald's restaurants in the early years. Although the ""Golden Arches"" logo appeared in various forms, the present version as a letter ""M"" did not appear until November 18, 1968, when the company applied for a U.S. trademark. The present corporation dates its founding to the opening of a franchised restaurant by businessman Ray Kroc in Des Plaines, Illinois on April 15, 1955, the ninth McDonald's restaurant overall; this location was demolished in 1984 after many remodels. Kroc later purchased the McDonald brothers' equity in the company and led its worldwide expansion, and the company became listed on the public stock markets ten years later. Kroc was also noted for aggressive business practices, compelling the McDonald brothers to leave the fast-food industry. Kroc and the McDonald brothers all feuded over control of the business, as documented in both Kroc's autobiography and in the McDonald brothers' autobiography. The San Bernardino restaurant was demolished in 1976 (1971, according to Juan Pollo) and the site was sold to the Juan Pollo restaurant chain. This area now serves as headquarters for the Juan Pollo chain, as well as a McDonald's and Route 66 museum. According to Fast Food Nation by Eric Schlosser (2001), nearly one in eight workers in the U.S. have at some time been employed by McDonald's. Employees are encouraged by McDonald's Corp. to maintain their health by singing along to their favorite songs in order to relieve stress, attending church services in order to have a lower blood pressure, and taking two vacations annually in order to reduce risk for myocardial infarction.

Cornelius Chairman of the Board Kasper Jakobsen President and Chief Executive Officer Number of employees 5,600 (2010) Website Mead Johnson Nutrition Mead Johnson Nutrition Company is a major manufacturer of infant formula both domestically and globally with its flagship product Enfamil. The company dates back to a firm created by Edward Mead Johnson, one of the co-founders of Johnson &amp; Johnson, who created his own business in 1895, which was renamed Mead Johnson &amp; Company in 1905. The company was majority owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb after an acquisition in 1967, but was spun off in 2009 as an independent firm. The company had global sales of $2.83 billion in 2009, with two-thirds of its revenue coming from outside the United States, where declining birth rates have led to a reduced market share. The company is gaining a presence in such emerging markets as the People's Republic of China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam and is also starting to develop a presence in India. Enfamil, the company's flagship brand, commanded 11.7% of the $22.3 billion market for infant formula worldwide in 2008. Originally the product came as a powder which was mixed with water and contained powdered skim milk, soybean flour and corn oil and was fortified with vitamins and minerals, a formula that included more protein than other diet products. The Metrecal diet plan had people consume four self-prepared shakes (or portion-controlled cans) of Metrecal a day, with each can providing 225 calories. ^ Dorfman, Brad.

Its work in heart rhythm therapies dates back to 1957, when co-founder Earl Bakken developed the first wearable heart pacemaker to treat abnormally slow heart rates. Since then, CRDM has expanded its expertise in electrical stimulation to treat other cardiac rhythm diseases. CRDM has also made an effort to address overall disease management by adding diagnostic and monitoring capabilities to many of its devices. An independently operating Dutch pacemaker manufacturer Vitatron, acquired by Medtronic in 1986, is now a European subsidiary of the Medtronic CRDM unit. In May 2008, Medtronic Spine agreed to pay the U.S. government $75 million to settle a qui tam (whistleblower) lawsuit alleging that Medtronic committed Medicare fraud. The company was charged with illegally convincing healthcare providers to offer kyphoplasty, a spinal fracture repair surgery, as an inpatient rather than outpatient procedure, thereby making thousands more in profits per surgery. On 11 May 2009, Medtronic announced it had chosen San Antonio, Texas, for the location of its new Diabetes Therapy Management and Education Center. The company announced that it expected 1,400 new jobs would be created to staff the 150,000-square-foot (14,000&#160;m2) facility. O-arm Surgical Imaging System.

(NYSE:&#160;MRK), d.b.a. Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (MSD) outside the United States and Canada, is an American pharmaceutical company and one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. The company was established in 1891 as the United States subsidiary of the German company Merck, which was founded in 1668 by the Merck family. Merck &amp; Co. was nationalized by the US government during World War I and subsequently established as an independent American company in 1917. While it operates as Merck &amp; Co. in North America, the original Merck based in Darmstadt holds the rights to the Merck name everywhere else. Merck &amp; Co. is the world's seventh largest pharmaceutical company by market capitalization and revenue. Its headquarters is located in Kenilworth, New Jersey. The Angel Pharmacy in Darmstadt, the beginning of the Merck company Merck &amp; Co. traces its origins to its original German parent company Merck, which was established by the Merck family in 1668 when Jacob Friedrich Merck purchased a drug store in Darmstadt. In the 19th century the Merck company in Darmstadt evolved from a pharmacy to a major pharmaceutical company which pioneered the commercial manufacture of morphine. In 1891, family member George (Georg) Merck emigrated to the United States and set up Merck &amp; Co. in New York as the US subsidiary of the family company. Merck &amp; Co. was nationalized by the US government in 1917 and re-established as an independent American company. Until the end of World War II, the company was led by George W. Merck. Merck &amp; Co. hold the trademark rights to the ""Merck"" name in North America, while its former parent company retains the rights in the rest of the world. The merger combined Merck &amp; Co.'s strength in scientific research and chemical manufacturing with Sharp &amp; Dohme's sales and distribution system and its marketing expertise. The combined company kept the trade name Merck in the United States and Canada, and as Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (MSD) outside North America. In 1965 Merck &amp; Co. acquired Charles E. Frosst Ltd. of Montreal (founded 1899) and created Merck-Frosst Canada, Inc., as its Canadian subsidiary and pharmaceutical research facility. Merck &amp; Co. closed this facility in July 2010, (In 2012, Medco merged with, and became a wholly owned subsidiary of, Express Scripts Holding Co.) As of December 2013, the US company had approximately 76,000 employees in 120 countries with 31 factories worldwide. It is one of the world's seven largest pharmaceutical companies. The Merck Company Foundation has distributed more than $480 million to educational and non-profit organizations since it was founded in 1957 (and $740 million in overall charitable distributions). In October 2013, Merck &amp; Co. announced it would cut 8,500 jobs in an attempt to cut $2.5bn (£1.5bn) from its costs by 2015. The company's shares rose 2.35% to US$48.73 in New York trading after it announced the cuts. The new losses, combined with 7,500 job cuts announced in 2011 and 2012, amount in total to 20% of its workforce. Days later Merck &amp; Co. announced it would spend $95 million up front on collaborating with cCAM Biotherapeutics and its lead candidate (an early-stage treatment similar to Keytruda). The company is due up to $510 million more, which is tied to clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones. Merck &amp; Co. will bring in CM-24, an antibody designed to block the immune checkpoint CEACAM1. with both collaborations potentially generating up to $595 million and $280 million respectively. Days later the company announced it would acquire IOmet Pharma, with IOmet becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co. The acquisition includes IOmets IDO (indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1), TDO (tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase), and dual-acting inhibitors. In 191 of 193 countries the original Merck company, Merck KGaA of Darmstadt, owns the rights to the ""Merck"" name. In the United States and Canada the company trades under the name EMD. In the United States and Canada Merck &amp; Co. holds the rights to the trademark ""Merck"", while in the rest of the world the company trades under the name MSD (an abbreviation of Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme). In 2015 Merck KGaA adopted a new logo and said it will be ""much more aggressive"" about protecting the brand of ""the real Merck."" Merck of Darmstadt has initiated litigation against its former subsidiary, Merck &amp; Co. (MSD) of Kenilworth, in several countries over infringing use of the Merck name. In 2016, the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom ruled that MSD had breached an agreement with its former parent company and that only Merck of Darmstadt is entitled to use the Merck name in the United Kingdom.

Sales in 2013 amounted to $2.7 billion. Zetia has been controversial, as it was initially approved based on its impact on serum cholesterol levels without proof that it actually impacted the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Results of the IMPROVE-IT study, however, introduced at the 2014 Scientific Sessions of the American Heart Association, showed a statistically significant, albeit modest, benefit in adding Zetia to simvastatin for high-risk, post-acute-coronary-syndrome patients. Remicade (infliximab) is a monoclonal antibody directed toward the cytokine TNF-alpha and used for the treatment of a wide range of autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, and others. Remicade and other TNF-alpha inhibitors exhibit additive therapeutic effects with methotrexate and improve quality of life. Adverse effects include increased risk of infection and certain cancers. Gardasil (recombinant human papilloma virus vaccine) is a vaccine against multiple serotypes of human papilloma virus (HPV), which is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer worldwide. Isentress (raltegravir) is a human immunodeficiency virus integrase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection. It is the first anti-HIV compound having this mechanism of action. Keytruda (pembrolizumab) is an immune modulator for the treatment of cancer. On September 4, 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as a breakthrough therapy for melanoma treatment. Invanz (Ertapenem) is an injectable antibiotic, rights to which Merck has owned since 1999. and the first trivalent measles, mumps, rubella (MMR vaccine),) In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Vioxx (known generically as rofecoxib), a Merck product for treating arthritis. Vioxx was designed as a selective inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-2. Such compounds were expected to cause less gastrointestinal bleeding than older anti-inflammatory drugs such as naproxen, which were associated with 20,000 hospitalizations and 2000 deaths each year. Fosamax (alendronate) is a bisphosphonate used for the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and for the prevention of skeletal problems in certain cancers. The American College of Clinical Endocrinology, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the North American Menopause Society and the UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group recommend alendronate and certain other bisphosphonates as first line treatments for post-menopausal osteopotosis. In 1991, Merck's Kelco subsidiary was responsible for volatile organic compound (VOC) emission pollution in the San Diego area. In 1996 Merck paid $1.8 million for polluting the air. New machines were installed to reduce smog emissions by 680,000&#160;lb (310,000&#160;kg) a year."

Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (December 2015) As of 2010, the company was ""organized into five segments: Insurance Products, Retirement Products,"" the US Business (including Auto &amp; Home and Corporate Benefit Funding), and International. This section requires expansion. (December 2015) As of 2011, MetLife's chief executive officer was Steve Kandarian. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower, which previously served as company headquarters, was featured in its advertising for many years. A severe business depression that began with the Panic of 1873 forced the company to contract, until it reached its lowest point in the late 1870s. After observing the insurance industry in Great Britain in 1879, MetLife President Joseph F. Knapp brought “industrial” or “workingmen’s” insurance programs to the United States – insurance issued in small amounts on which premiums were collected weekly or monthly at the policyholder’s home. By 1880, sales had exceeded a quarter million of such policies, resulting in nearly $1 million in revenue from premiums. In 1909, MetLife had become the nation’s largest life insurer in the U.S., as measured by life insurance in force (the total value of life insurance policies issued). In 1907, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower was commissioned to serve as MetLife’s 23rd Street headquarters in Lower Manhattan. Completed two years later, the building was the world's tallest until 1913 and remained the company's headquarters until 2005. For many years, an illustration of the building (with light emanating from the tip of its spire and the slogan, ""The Light That Never Fails"") featured prominently in MetLife’s advertising. In 2012, MetLife failed the Federal Reserve’s (the Fed's) Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test, intended to predict the potential failure of the company in a recession. The Fed stated that the minimum total risk-based capital ratio should be 8% and it estimated MetLife's ratio at only 6%. The company had requested approval for a US$2 billion share repurchase to prop up the stock price, along with an increased dividend.

(September 2013) MetLife Hall of Records, Yonkers, New York. As of 2010, MetLife had a ""diverse product mix"" which included insurance (home, car and life), variable life annuities and structured settlements, Commercial mortgages and securities backed by commercial mortgages, and sovereign debt. Plans include MetLife’s Preferred Dentist Program (PPO) and the SafeGuard DHMO (available for both individuals and employees in CA, FL, and TX). As of May 2010, MetLife’s dental PPO network included over 135,000 participating dentist locations nationwide while the dental HMO network included more than 13,000 participating dentist locations in California, Florida and Texas. MetLife also administers dental continuing education program for dentists and allied health care professionals, which are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) and the Academy of General Dentistry (AGD). and offers flood insurance policies as a participant in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is managed by the federal government. On March 8, 2010, Met Life announced its intent to purchase the international leader life-insurance business, American Life Insurance Company (Alico), from American International Group (AIG). MetLife, which completed the deal on November 1, 2010, paid approximately $7.2 billion in cash and $9.0 billion in MetLife equity and other securities. In India MetLife has an affiliate company India Insurance Company Limited (MetLife) which has operated in India since 2001. This company has its headquarters in Bangalore and Gurgaon and was jointly owned by MetLife and a few local Indian financial companies. In 2012 an agreement was made with local Indian bank, the Punjab National Bank to establish a strategic alliance and for it to take a 30% share in MetLife India. In 1959, The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (as it was known at the time) released tables of the best weight for each height for longevity, based on their collected insurance data. These tables showed the “desirable weights”. In 1983, they released tables showing the “ideal” weights for greatest longevity; this information was based on data collected in the Build Study of 1979 collected by the Society of Actuaries. This data followed patients for 18 years (from 1954-1972) and was collected from 25 life insurance companies in Canada and the United States, representing 4.2 million people. These “ideal” weights were higher than the prior “desirable” weights, this was attributed to an increase in muscle mass due to improved fitness levels among the population. This study is still the largest available pool of data for this purpose. It was noticed that the average weights in the population are higher than the ideal weights for survival. The ‘’’Metropolitan Tables’’’ included ‘’small’’, ‘’medium’’ and ‘’large’’ frames, based on elbow-girth measured using calipers, as the elbows do not develop adipose tissue. They presented weight ranges for height, sex and body frame (again associated with the lowest mortality) The mid-point of the ideal weight for the medium frames for each height was selected as the “ideal” weight used for calculations of “excess weight” (initial weight-ideal weight). This led to a formula to calculate the ideal weight used by bariatric surgeons, but it had lost considerable accuracy by 2007, again due to improvements in medical care and in public health. For three consecutive years (2008–2010) the company has also appeared on FORTUNE’s list of the most-admired companies. For eleven consecutive years (1999–2009) MetLife has been named by Working Mother magazine as one of the “100 Best Companies for Working Mothers,” specifically for offering flexible schedules, remote working capabilities and various child care options. MetLife has also been awarded a perfect score for seven consecutive years (2004–2010) by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation for its “Corporate Equality Index-Best Companies for People who are Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, or Transgendered.”"

Its consumer products are marketed under the brands Crucial Technology and Lexar. Micron and Intel together created IM Flash Technologies, which produces NAND flash memory. Micron was named one of Thomson Reuters top 100 global innovators in 2012  This article is in a list format that may be better presented using prose.

(November 2014) 1978–1999 Startup funding was provided by local Idaho businessmen Tom Nicholson, Allen Noble, Rudolph Nelson, and Ron Yanke. Later it received funding from Idaho billionaire J. R. Simplot, whose fortune was made in the potato business. In 1981, its first wafer fabrication unit (""Fab 1"") with 50,000 square feet (4,600&#160;m2) of space was completed and Micron started producing 64K DRAM chips. A second fab was completed in late 1984 to produce 256K DRAM chips. ZEOS International, Micron Computer, and Micron Custom Manufacturing Services (MCMS) merged in 1996 to become Micron Electronics. In 2002, armed with the Sherman Antitrust Act, the United States Department of Justice began a probe into the activities of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) manufacturers. U.S. computer makers, including Dell and Gateway, claimed that inflated DRAM pricing was causing lost profits and hindering their effectiveness in the marketplace. To date, five manufacturers have pleaded guilty to their involvement in an international price-fixing conspiracy. These manufacturers are Hynix, Infineon, Micron Technology, Samsung, and Elpida. Micron Technology was not fined for its involvement, due to cooperation with investigators. In June 2007, Steve Appleton gave up the title of President to COO Mark Durcan. In March 2008, Micron launched Aptina Imaging, a spin-off of its CMOS Image Sensor Division (currently part of ON Semiconductor). Aptina Imaging was partially sold to a group including TPG and Riverwood Capital, and became an independent, privately held company in July 2009. Micron remains a partial owner in the company. On February 23, 2012, Micron Technology will become the largest shareholder of Inotera Memories, a major DRAM (dynamic random access memory) maker in Taiwan, after fully subscribing 763 million shares issued by Inotera for a capital increment of NT$5 billion via private placement. On February 28, 2012, Micron and Intel announced that they would expand their NAND Flash memory joint venture relationship, to increase the flexibility and efficiency of the joint venture. Intel would sell its stake in IM Flash Singapore to Micron, along with its share of IM Flash Technologies assets in Micron's plant in Manassas, Virginia. On July 2, 2012, Micron announced they would buy, for $2.5 billion, the bankrupt Elpida Memory, as well as an additional 24% share (in addition to the 65% acquired through Elpida) in Rexchip Electronics from Powerchip. On January 20, 2014 (less than 4 years after the acquisition of Numonyx, 1000 employees in Italy), Micron announced the lay off of the 40% of its Italian workforce (419 employees, almost one third of the overall announced worldwide cuts). Micron announced in February 2016 that it is upping 3D NAND production and that its 3D NAND technology is now available in 2 bit per cell flash memory (MLC), as well as three bit per cell (TLC) 3D flash memory. Micron makes DRAM Memory components and modules, including SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, DDR2 SDRAM, DDR3 SDRAM, DDR4 SDRAM, LPDRAM, RLDRAM, PSRAM, and multi-chip packages. It also makes NAND, Managed NAND and NOR flash memory, and SSDs. In late 2009, the company was the first to announce a solid-state drive (SSD) using a 6 Gbit/s SATA interface."

Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. It is the world's largest software maker by revenue,, Microsoft is market dominant in both the IBM PC-compatible operating system (while it lost the majority of the overall operating system market to Android) and office software suite markets (the latter with Microsoft Office). The company also produces a wide range of other software for desktops and servers, and is active in areas including Internet search (with Bing), the video game industry (with the Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles), the digital services market (through MSN), and mobile phones (via the operating systems of Nokia's former phones and Windows Phone OS). In June 2012, Microsoft entered the personal computer production market for the first time, with the launch of the Microsoft Surface, a line of tablet computers. With the acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division to form Microsoft Mobile Oy, the company re-entered the smartphone hardware market, after its previous attempt, Microsoft Kin, which resulted from their acquisition of Danger Inc.

IBM called Microsoft in July 1980 inquiring about programming languages for its upcoming PC line; The January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics, which Allen bought at Out of Town News, featured Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems's (MITS) Altair 8800 microcomputer. However, it was MS-DOS that solidified the company's dominance. After negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the CP/M OS, which was set to be used in the upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC). Microsoft released its version of OS/2 to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) on April 2, 1987;:243–244 meanwhile, the company was at work on a 32-bit OS, Microsoft Windows NT, using ideas from OS/2; it shipped on July 21, 1993, with a new modular kernel and the Win32 application programming interface (API), making porting from 16-bit (MS-DOS-based) Windows easier. Once Microsoft informed IBM of NT, the OS/2 partnership deteriorated.:20 Windows 95 came bundled with the online service MSN (which was at first intended to be a competitor to the Internet), and for OEMs Internet Explorer, a web browser. Internet Explorer was not bundled with the retail Windows 95 boxes because the boxes were printed before the team finished the web browser, and instead was included in the Windows 95 Plus! pack. In March 2004 the European Union brought antitrust legal action against the company, citing it abused its dominance with the Windows OS, resulting in a judgment of €497&#160;million ($613&#160;million) and to produce new versions of Windows XP without Windows Media Player, Windows XP Home Edition N and Windows XP Professional N. The European Union imposed another fine of €899&#160;million ($1.4&#160;billion) for Microsoft's lack of compliance with the March 2004 judgment on February 27, 2008, saying that the company charged rivals unreasonable prices for key information about its workgroup and backoffice servers. Microsoft stated that it was in compliance and that ""these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved"". The Kinect, the motion sensing input devices by Microsoft, which was first introduced in November 2010 was upgraded for the 2013 release of the eighth-generation Xbox One. Its capabilities were revealed in May 2013. The new Kinect uses an ultra-wide 1080p camera, it can function in the dark due to an infrared sensor, it employs higher-end processing power and new software, it can distinguish between fine movements (such as a thumb movements), and the device can determine a user's heart rate by looking at his/her face. The Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI) was launched in October 2013 and Microsoft is part of the coalition of public and private organizations that also includes Facebook, Intel and Google. Led by Tim Berners-Lee, the A4AI seeks to make Internet access more affordable so that access is broadened in the developing world, where only 31% of people are online. Google will help to decrease internet access prices so that they fall below the UN Broadband Commission's worldwide target of 5% of monthly income. (Part of the Surface family) In Q1 2015, Microsoft is the third largest maker of mobile phones selling 33 million units (7.2% of all), while a large majority (at least 75%) of them do not run any version of Windows Phone – those other phones are not categorized as smartphones by Gartner – in the same time frame 8 million Windows smartphones (2.5% of all smartphones) where made by all manufacturers (but mostly by Microsoft).

McInnerney. The company was formed to execute a rollup strategy in the fragmented United States ice cream industry, and with acquisitions it expanded into the full range of dairy products. McInnerney operated the Hydrox Corporation, a Chicago ice-cream company. In 1923 he went to Wall Street to ask investment bankers to finance his plan to consolidate the United States ice-cream industry. McInnerney initially encountered resistance, with one banker disparaging the dairy industry. He persevered, convincing a consortium (including Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers) to finance a rollup strategy. not only had no advertising appropriation whatsoever, but had not even been distributed for several years"". According to internal documents of J. Walter Thompson (the advertising firm which conceived the marketing test), ""Although there was no other advertising support for it whatsoever, still grocery stores could not keep up with the demand."" During the decade the company offered mixed results to its shareholders, as new acquisitions in the food business (such as Churny cheese, Lender's Bagels, Frusen Gladje ice cream and Celestial Seasonings tea) slightly offset its lagging nonfood business (Tupperware and KitchenAid). Dart and Kraft spun off its nonfood business (except Duracell) into a new entity (Premark International) and changed its name back to Kraft. Premark was bought by Illinois Tool Works in 1999. In 1988 Kraft sold Duracell to private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which included it in a 1989 initial public offering. At the end of 1988, Philip Morris purchased Kraft for $12.9 billion. The following year Kraft merged with Philip Morris's General Foods unit (manufacturers of Oscar Mayer meats, Maxwell House coffee, Jell-O gelatin, Budget Gourmet frozen dinners, Entenmann's baked goods, Kool-Aid, Crystal Light, and Tang powdered beverage mixes, Post Cereals, Shake 'n Bake flavored coatings, and other packaged foods) as Kraft General Foods. Product development slowed after the merger, due to the company's size. In 1990, the company acquired Jacobs Suchard (a large European coffee and confectionery company) and Freia Marabou (a Scandinavian confectionery maker) to expand overseas. Three years later it acquired RJR&#160;Nabisco's cold-cereal business (primarily Shredded Wheat and Shreddies cereals), selling the Breyers ice-cream division to Unilever and the Birds Eye unit to Dean Foods. In 1994 the company sold its frozen-dinner unit to Heinz, and the following year it sold its food-service unit. In 1995, the company changed its name to Kraft Foods and sold its bakery division (except Lender's Bagels, which was sold to CPC International the following year), its candy division and its table-spreads division. Log Cabin Syrup was sold in 1997. In July 2007, the company bought Groupe Danone's biscuit and cereal division (including the French biscuit brand Lefèvre-Utile) for $7.2 billion. In February 2008 Berkshire Hathaway, run by investor Warren Buffett, announced that it had acquired an eight-percent stake in Kraft (then worth over $4 billion); Buffett's business partner, Charlie Munger, had also invested over $300 million in Kraft. According to the holding company's 2010 annual report, Berkshire Hathaway owned 5.6 percent of Kraft Foods' outstanding stock. On November 9 the company's bid (then £9.8 billion) was rejected by Cadbury, which called it a ""derisory"" offer. On January 19, 2010, Cadbury approved a revised offer from Kraft which valued the company at £11.5 billion ($19.5 billion). Some funds for the takeover were provided by the Royal Bank of Scotland, the British partially state-owned bank. Cadbury sales were flat after Kraft’s acquisition. Despite the Cadbury takeover's helping to boost sales by 30 percent, Kraft's net profit for the fourth quarter fell 24 percent (to $540 million) due to costs associated with integrating the UK business after the acquisition. Kraft increased prices to offset rising commodity costs (for corn, sugar, and cocoa) in North America and Europe. According to Rosenfeld]], ""We expect it will remain weak for the foreseeable future"". Taking into account integration costs, the acquisition reduced Kraft's earnings per share by about 33% immediately after the Cadbury purchase. In March 2011 Kraft closed the plant, listing the site for £50 million and outsourcing production (which the company had promised not to do) to Poland. Although former Cadbury workers demanded an apology for the plant's abrupt sale, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld did not explain the company's action. The company changed its name to Mondelez International, specializing in snack foods, in October 2012 and a second company (Kraft Foods Group, specializing in grocery items) was split off. Health claims such as ""a wholesome choice"" (on Teddy Grahams) and ""sensible snacking"" (on several products) are false. ""No cholesterol"" claims are misleading, because they imply that the snack is good for cholesterol levels when trans fats are worse for cholesterol health than dietary cholesterol. Claims such as ""made with real vegetables"" or ""real ginger and molasses"" are misleading, because the products contain less of those ingredients than trans fats. Although Teddy Grahams packaging claimed to be a ""good source of calcium, iron, and zinc to support kids' growth and development"", the claim was deceptive because its trans-fat content outweighed the minerals' benefit. Phrases such as ""whole wheat"" and ""graham"" implied health benefits the products do not possess. On each package, some individual claims may be true but add to the deceptive message of overall healthfulness. Kraft denied any wrongdoing, and its response briefs emphasized that its claims were technically true. Vegetable Thins were ""made with real vegetables"", and the company argued that the statement could not be considered misleading. Kraft used a similar argument for claims such as ""good source of calcium, iron and zinc to support kids' growth and development"" and ""whole wheat"". About several packaging claims, Kraft argued that the statements could not be proven true or false; for example, the word ""wholesome"" is subjective. Promotional statements too vague to prove or disprove (known as puffery) are not actionable under law; Kraft argued that ""wholesome,"" ""sensible"", and ""smart"" are puffery and could not be found misleading or deceitful. The US Commodity and Futures Commission (CTFC) alleged that Mondelez International and its former subsidiary, Mondelez Global, bought $90 million (£61 million) of wheat futures with no intention of taking delivery. According to the CTFC, the purchase raised the price of the commodity and earned the company $5.4 million. In April 2009, Kraft Foods recalled products containing pistachios after the discovery of salmonella at one of its Illinois manufacturers. Kraft pinpointed as the source a California pistachio grower, which initially recalled over 2,000,000 pounds (910,000&#160;kg) of nuts before broadening the recall to much of its 2008 crop. ^ a b c ""Google Finance - Financial Results - Mondelez International Inc"".

It is a leading producer of genetically engineered (GE) seed and Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide. Monsanto's role in agricultural changes, biotechnology products, lobbying of government agencies, and history as a chemical company have made the company controversial. Founded in 1901 by John Francis Queeny, Monsanto initially produced food additives like saccharin and vanillin, expanded into industrial chemicals like sulfuric acid and PCBs in the 1920s, and by the 1940s was a major producer of plastics, including polystyrene and synthetic fibers. Notable achievements by Monsanto and its scientists as a chemical company included breakthrough research on catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation and being the first company to mass-produce light emitting diodes (LEDs). The company also formerly manufactured controversial products such as the insecticide DDT, PCBs, Agent Orange, and recombinant bovine somatotropin (a.k.a. bovine growth hormone). Monsanto was among the first to genetically modify a plant cell, as one of four groups announcing the introduction of genes into plants in 1983, Contents 1 History 1.1 1901 to WWII 1.2 Post-war period 1.3 1960s and 1970s 1.4 1980s to early 1990s: emphasis on agribiotech 1.5 1996 to present: growth into world's largest-grossing seed company 1.6 Spin-offs and mergers 1.7 Acquisition history 2 Products and associated issues 2.1 Current products 2.1.1 Glyphosate herbicides 2.1.2 Crop seed 2.1.2.1 India-specific issues 2.2 Former products 2.2.1 Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 2.2.1.1 United States 2.2.1.2 United Kingdom 2.2.2 rBGH (recombinant bovine growth hormone) 2.3 Pipeline products 2.3.1 Glyphosate-resistant wheat 2.4 Pipeline products - cancelled 2.4.1 Terminator seeds 2.4.2 Animal genetics 3 Legal actions and controversies 3.1 Litigation 3.2 Controversies outside the US 3.2.1 Argentina 3.2.2 Brazil 3.2.3 China 3.2.4 India 3.3 March Against Monsanto protests 4 Political contributions and lobbying 4.1 United States 4.2 United Kingdom 4.3 Continental Europe 5 Donations 6 U.S. public officials' connections 7 Sponsorships 8 Awards 9 See also 10 Documentaries 11 References 12 Bibliography 13 External links History by John Francis Queeny, a 30‑year veteran of the pharmaceutical industry. He funded the start-up with his own money and capital from a soft drink distributor and gave the company his wife's maiden name (his father-in-law was Emmanuel Mendes de Monsanto, a wealthy financier of a sugar company active in Vieques, Puerto Rico, and based in St. Thomas in the Danish West Indies). The company's first products were commodity food additives, like the artificial sweetener saccharin, caffeine, and vanillin. Monsanto expanded to Europe in 1919 by entering a partnership with Graesser's Chemical Works at Cefn Mawr, near Ruabon Wales, to produce vanillin, aspirin and its raw ingredient salicylic acid, and later rubber processing chemicals. This site was later sold and closed in 2010. In the 1920s Monsanto expanded into basic industrial chemicals like sulfuric acid and PCBs. Queeny's son Edgar Monsanto Queeny took over the company in 1928. In 1926 the company founded and incorporated a town called Monsanto in Illinois (now known as Sauget). It was formed to provide minimal regulation and low taxes for the Monsanto chemical plants at a time when local jurisdictions had most of the responsibility for environmental rules. It was renamed in honor of Leo Sauget, its first village president. In 1936 Monsanto acquired Thomas &amp; Hochwalt Laboratories in Dayton, Ohio, in order to acquire the expertise of Charles Allen Thomas and Dr. Carroll A. (""Ted"") Hochwalt. The acquisition was subsequently made Monsanto's Central Research Department.:340–341 Thomas spent the rest of his career at Monsanto, serving as President (1951–60) and Chairman of the Board (1960–65). He retired in 1970. In 1943, Thomas was called to a meeting in Washington DC with Brig. Gen. Leslie Groves, commander of the Manhattan Project, and with James Conant, president of Harvard University and chairman of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC). In 2001 Knowles and Ryōji Noyori won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In the mid-1960s chemists at Monsanto developed the Monsanto process for making acetic acid, which until 2000 was the method most widely used to make this important industrial chemical. In 1964 Monsanto chemists invented AstroTurf (but called ChemGrass early on),:6 In 1968, it became the first company to start mass production of (visible) light emitting diodes (LEDs), using gallium arsenide phosphide. This ushered in the era of solid-state lights. From 1968 to 1970, sales doubled every few months. Their products (discrete LEDs and seven-segment numeric displays) became the standards of industry. The primary markets then were electronic calculators, digital watches, and digital clocks. In 1979, Monsanto established the Edgar Monsanto Queeny safety award in honor of its former CEO (1928‑1960), an annual $2,000 prize given to a member of the American Society of Safety Engineers to encourage accident prevention. which in 1998 became the first selective COX‑2 inhibitor to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 2000 (October): Pharmacia spun off its Monsanto subsidiary into a new company,) 2005: Monsanto acquired Emergent Genetics and its Stoneville and NexGen cotton brands. Emergent was the third largest U.S. cotton seed company, with about 12 percent of the U.S. market. Monsanto's goal was to obtain ""a strategic cotton germplasm and traits platform.""

It performs economic research related to credit analysis, performance management, financial modeling, structured analysis and financial risk management. Moody's Analytics also offers software and consulting services, including proprietary economic models and software tools, as well as professional training for the financial services sector, particularly risk management accreditation.

A filer is a type of disk-storage device which owns and controls a filesystem, and presents files and directories to hosts over the network. This scheme is sometimes called file storage, as opposed to the block storage which major storage vendors like EMC Corporation and Hitachi Data Systems have traditionally provided. NetApp's filers initially used NFS and CIFS protocols based on standard local area networks (LANs), whereas block storage consolidation required storage area networks (SANs) implemented with the Fibre Channel (FC) protocol. In 2002, in an attempt to increase market share, NetApp added block-storage access as well. As of 2016 NetApp systems support it via FC protocol, the iSCSI protocol, and the emerging Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) protocol. The filers use NetApp's proprietary operating system called Data ONTAP which includes code from Berkeley Net/2 BSD Unix, Spinnaker Networks technology, and other operating systems. Data ONTAP originally only supported NFS, but later added support for CIFS, iSCSI and Fibre Channel (including Fibre Channel over Ethernet). At one point On September 9, 2010, NetApp announced an agreement with Oracle Corporation (the new owner of Sun Microsystems) to dismiss the suits."

As of September 2013, for that year's third quarter report, Netflix reported its total of global streaming subscribers at 40.4 million (31.2 million in the U.S.). with only 30 employees and 925 works available for rent through a traditional pay-per-rental model (50¢US per rental U.S. postage; late fees applied). Netflix initiated an initial public offering (IPO) on May 29, 2002, selling 5.5 million shares of common stock at the price of US$15.00 per share. On June 14, 2002, the company sold an additional 825,000 shares of common stock at the same price. After incurring substantial losses during its first few years, Netflix posted its first profit during fiscal year 2003, earning US$6.5 million profit on revenues of US$272 million. In 2005, 35,000 different film titles were available, and Netflix shipped 1 million DVDs out every day. In April 2012, Netflix filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form a political action committee (PAC) called FLIXPAC. Netflix spokesperson Joris Evers indicated that the PAC was not set up to support the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA), tweeting that the intent was to ""engage on issues like net neutrality, bandwidth caps, UBB and VPPA."" In June 2014, Netflix unveiled a redesigned version of its logo (using a modified typeface, and removing the drop shadowing and red background of the previous logo) and website UI. The change was controversial; some liked the new minimalist design, whereas others felt more comfortable with the old interface. In January 2016 Netflix announced it would begin blocking virtual private networks (VPN) When the streaming service first launched, Netflix's traditional rental-disc subscribers were given access at no additional charge. Subscribers were allowed approximately one hour of streaming per dollar spent on the monthly subscription (a $16.99 plan, for example, entitled the subscriber to 17 hours of streaming media). In January 2008, however, Netflix lifted this restriction, at which point virtually all rental-disc subscribers became entitled to unlimited streaming at no additional cost (however, subscribers on the restricted plan of two DVDs per month ($4.99) remained limited to two hours of streaming per month). This change came in a response to the introduction of Hulu and to Apple's new video-rental services. Currently, Netflix's Internet video streaming subscription rates range from $7.99 to $11.99 a month, including a free one-month trial. Until October 10, 2014, Netflix did not officially support playback on Linux PCs, although the Linux-based Roku devices are supported. It is possible to connect the Roku device, game console, or Blu-ray Disc player to a Linux PC (or directly to the computer monitor) with an adapter. It is also possible to run Windows and Netflix in a virtual machine such as Virtualbox or QEMU. In a TechRepublic interview in August 2010, Netflix's VP of Corporate Communications stated that available Silverlight plugins for Linux, such as Moonlight, do not support the PlayReady DRM system that Netflix requires for playback. The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change. ""Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies people who just want DVDs"", Netflix wrote on its blog. ""Creating an unlimited-DVDs-by-mail plan (no streaming) at our lowest price ever, $7.99, does make sense and will ensure a long life for our DVDs-by-mail offering."" that Netflix would, in 2013, assume the pay-TV rights to films from DreamWorks Animation (those output rights were then held by HBO). Disc rental The subscriber can keep the rented disc as long as desired, but there is a limit on the number of discs (determined by subscription level) that each subscriber can have on loan simultaneously. To rent a new film, the subscriber must mail the previous one back to Netflix in a metered reply mail envelope. Upon receipt of the disc, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue. Netflix offers several pricing tiers for DVD rental of one to three DVDs at a time. Subscribers with accounts in good standing can upgrade Profiles allow one subscriber account to contain multiple users (for example, a couple, two roommates, or parent and child) with separate DVD queues, ratings, recommendations, friend lists, reviews, and intra-site communications for each. Netflix contended that elimination of profiles would improve the customer experience. Netflix introduced a ""Profiles"" feature on August 1, 2013 that permits accounts to accommodate up to five unique user profiles, associated either with individuals or themes of their choosing (e.g., ""Date Night""). ""Profiles"" effectively segregates the viewing habits of each profile category (e.g., family member) so that each profile will receive individualized suggestions and the ability to add its own favorite titles. This is important, according to Todd Yellin, Netflix's vice president of product innovation, because, ""About 75 percent to 80 percent of what people watch on Netflix comes from what Netflix recommends, not from what people search for"".) Neil Hunt, Netflix's chief product officer, told CNNMoney: ""profiles are another way to stand out in the crowded streaming-video space"", and, ""The company said focus-group testing showed that profiles generate more viewing and more engagement"". People don't always watch Netflix alone, and shows watched from a profile that accommodate one's viewing partner(s) – whose tastes may not reflect those of the profile owner(s) – affect recommendations made to that profile Netflix revealed a prototype of the new device called ""The Switch"" at the 2015 World Maker Faire New York. ""The Switch"" allows Netflix users to turn off lights when connected to a smart home light system. It also connects to users' local networks to enable their servers to order takeout, and silence ones phone at the press of a button. Though the device hasn't been patented Netflix released instructions, on their website, on how to build it at home (DIY). The instructions cover both the electrical structure and the programming processes. In November 2013, Netflix and Marvel Television (a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company) announced a five-season deal to produce live action series focused on four Marvel superheroes: Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. The deal involves the release of four 13-episode seasons that culminate in a mini-series called The Defenders. The programs are planned for a 2015 debut. In September 2014, Netflix beat out Amazon Prime and Hulu for the rights to Love, a new romantic-comedy series from Judd Apatow, Lesley Arfin, and Paul Rust (who will star alongside Gillian Jacobs). It also announced that Hemlock Grove was renewed for a third and final season, released in October 2015. This article is outdated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (January 2016) Netflix currently has exclusive ""pay TV window"" deals with major and mini-major studios (the ""pay TV"" deals in essence, give Netflix exclusive streaming rights and are not distinct from the distribution rights held by traditional pay television services, which are also effectively prohibited from obtaining first-run linear television rights with these deals). As of 2014, films featured on ""Watch Instantly"" service in the United States include recent releases from Relativity Media (and its subsidiary Rogue Pictures), as well as titles from DreamWorks Animation (DreamWorks Animation began streaming its films in 2013 after the expiration of HBO's previous deal with the studio),), FilmDistrict, and Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (including Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Disneynature, Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel Studios), among others. Epix (one of the first traditional pay television channels to launch a Netflix-style streaming service) signed a five-year streaming deal with Netflix in which for the first two years, first-run as well as back catalog content from Epix was exclusive to Netflix (Epix films will come to Netflix 90 days after they premiere on Epix. The exclusivity clause ended on September 4, 2012, when Amazon signed a deal with Epix to distribute its rights to its Amazon Video streaming service. These include films from Paramount Pictures, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Lionsgate). On December 4, 2012, Netflix and The Walt Disney Company announced an exclusive multi-year agreement for the first-run U.S. subscription television rights to Walt Disney Studios' animated and live-action films. New titles from Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios and Disneynature will be available on Netflix beginning in 2016 (assuming the rights from Starz, making Disney the first major film studio not to distribute its films via a traditional pay television service). However, classic titles such as Dumbo, Pocahontas, and Alice in Wonderland immediately became available on the service. On January 14, 2013, Netflix signed an agreement with Time Warner subsidiaries Turner Broadcasting System and Warner Bros. Television to distribute content from Cartoon Network, Warner Bros. Animation, and Adult Swim, as well as TNT's revival of the drama Dallas beginning in March 2013. The streaming rights to Cartoon Network and Adult Swim programs came not long after the expiration of Viacom's rights deal to allow Netflix access to stream programs from Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. (which were subsequently assumed by Amazon Video). In Canada, Netflix has pay TV rights (approximately eight months after theatrical release) to films from Paramount, DreamWorks Animation and 20th Century Fox. In 2015, it will assume pay TV rights to films from Disney (including Disney Live Action, Disneynature, DreamWorks Studios, Lucasfilm, Marvel, Pixar, and Walt Disney Animation Studios) which are currently held by The Movie Network/Movie Central.

Windows Phone Video game consoles In November 2009, Netflix service became available on the Sony PlayStation 3. The set-up was similar to that on the Xbox 360, allowing Netflix subscribers to stream films and television shows from their Instant Queue to watch on the console. Unlike on the Xbox 360, the Netflix application was originally available on a Blu-ray Disc (available free to subscribers). On October 19, 2010, a downloadable application was made available through the PlayStation Network. This section is in a list format that may be better presented using prose.

(March 2016) In September 2009, Hastings expressed his desire to expand his company's video-streaming service to Apple's iPhone and iPod Touch mobile devices, once the Xbox 360 exclusivity deal expired. Netflix is also available on Windows Phone devices. On March 15, 2011, Netflix was available for Android phones; however, not all phones using the OS can use the application due to digital rights management (DRM) issues. Availability of Netflix, as of Jan. 2016: &#160;&#160;Available &#160;&#160;Not available This article may be too long to read and navigate comfortably. Please consider splitting content into sub-articles, condensing it, or adding or removing subheadings. (January 2016) 2010: Canada Rounding out the first five countries to launch streaming service in Latin America were Argentina, which followed on the 7th, Chile on the 8th, Colombia on the 9th, and Mexico on the 12th. Service spread to the other 38 countries in the following weeks. Among the content distributed to Latin America was programming from CBS, Miramax, and Showtime. The launch in Latin America was not as successful as the company had hoped. While in Latin America, Netflix had no streaming competitors as it did in Canada, the digital divide (a lack of high broadband internet penetration) hindered rapid growth. A banking system unused to recurrent monthly transactions exacerbated the problem. Still, while Latin American expansion happened more slowly than expected, Netflix was not out anything for the expansion and their Canadian expansion happened at a faster rate than expected, making their first two forays into the international market fairly successful. Additionally, despite the hindrances to growth in Latin America, Netflix continued in pursuit of content expansion, signing a deal with Fox in May 2012 (for a July 15 start) to make its popular content (e.g., How I Met Your Mother, Glee, Bones, The X-Files, Wall Street) available in the region. The initial launches in Canada and in Latin America happened (albeit barely) before Netflix's 2011 controversy in the United States. In September of that year, the company decided to switch to two separate plans (one for streaming and one for DVD), hiked its prices accordingly, and attempted a move to two websites (one for streaming and one for DVD rentals). The change to its business model was accompanied by a loss of approximately one million American users and a plunging stock price. Prior to announcing the change to service stock was valued at just around $300, after the price it plunged to less than $53 a share. In the UK, BARB (Broadcasters Audience Research Board) reported Netflix as being extremely successful in the UK market. More than one in ten households in the country subscribed to the service by 2014. On June 6, 2015, Reed Hastings announced, in an interview with the Portuguese newspaper Expresso, that Netflix would enter the Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish markets in October, and that it would install its Southern Europe support center (which will cover the previous three markets plus France) in Lisbon, Portugal. On January 6, 2016 at Consumer Electronics Show, Netflix announced a major international expansion into 130 new territories; with this expansion, the company promoted that its service would now be available nearly ""worldwide"", with the only notable exclusions including China, and regions subject to U.S. sanctions, such as Crimea (Ukraine), Syria, and North Korea. The company also announced a partnership with LG to market pre-paid services in Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. Hastings stated that any potential expansion into China could take ""many years"", owing to the tightly regulated state of the internet and media industries in the country. While the company admitted that some of its original productions (such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny) were meant to appeal to a potential Chinese audience, Hastings stated that the company was in the process of building relationships with local partners that it could possibly form a joint venture with."

Most are Salaried. 3,500 industry professionals in Nevada. Website http://www.newmont.com Newmont Mining Corporation, based in Greenwood Village, Colorado, USA, is one of the world's largest producers of gold, with active mines in Nevada, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Ghana and Peru. Holdings include Santa Fe Gold, Battle Mountain Gold, Normandy Mining, Franco-Nevada Corp and Fronteer Gold. Newmont also has many joint venture relationships. As of the third quarter of 2014, Newmont was the world's second-largest producer of gold, behind only Barrick Gold. In 1929, Newmont became a mining company with its first gold product in by acquiring California's Empire Star Mine. By 1939, Newmont was operating 12 gold mines in North America. The company acquired interests overseas. For decades around the middle of the 20th century, Newmont had a controlling interest in the Tsumeb mine in Namibia and in the O'Okiep Copper Company in Namaqualand, South Africa. Beginning in 1925, Newmont acquired interests in a Texas oil field. Eventually, Newmont's oil interests included more than 70 blocks in the Louisiana, Gulf of Mexico area and oil and gas production in the North Sea. Newmont discovered the world’s first submicroscopic or “invisible” gold at Carlin, Nevada in the early 1960s and began production on the first open pit gold mine in the world. The ""Carlin Trend"" or ""Carlin Unconformity"" is the largest gold discovery in North America during the 20th century. In 1971, Newmont began using the heap leaching technology on sub-mill grade ores there. In the 1980s, Newmont thwarted five takeover bids – from Consolidated Gold Fields (ConsGold), T. Boone Pickens, Minorco, Hanson Industries and Sir James Goldsmith – who sought to break Newmont apart and sell its assets to increase shareholder value. Major growth) to form North America's largest gold producer. On June 21, 2000, Newmont announced a merger with Battle Mountain Gold Company. The merger was completed in January 2001. In February 2002, Newmont completed the acquisition of Normandy Mining Limited and Franco-Nevada Mining Corporation Limited. Newmont faced competition in its bid for Normandy from AngloGold. By eventually outbiding the South African company, Newmont became the world's largest gold producer, with an annual production in excess of 8 million ounces. As of 2011, Newmont’s Nevada 14 open-pit and four underground operations include Carlin, located west of the city of Elko on the geologic feature known as the Carlin Trend; the Phoenix gold/copper mine, located 10 miles south of Battle Mountain, the Twin Creeks mine, located approximately 15 miles (24&#160;km) north of Golconda; and the Midas mine, near the town of the same name. It also participates in the Turquoise Ridge joint venture with a subsidiary of Barrick Gold Corporation, which utilizes mill capacity at Twin Creeks. With the acquisition of Fronteer Gold, over sixty additional projects were added to the Newmont portfolio. The flagship property, Long Canyon, is located on a gold trend that is similar to the Carlin Trend in terms of its characteristics and potential. Colorado The properties of Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. (“Yanacocha”) are located approximately 375 miles (604 kilometers) north of Lima and 30 miles (48 kilometers) north of Cajamarca, in Peru. Yanacocha began production in 1993. Newmont holds a 51.35% interest in Yanacocha with the remaining interest held by Compañia de Minas Buenaventura, S.A. (43.65%) and the International Finance Corporation (5%). Yanacocha’s mining rights consist of concessions granted by the Peruvian government to Yanacocha and a related entity. Yanacocha currently has three active open pit mines, Cerro Yanacocha, La Quinua and Chaquicocha. In addition, reclamation and/or backfilling activities at Carachugo, San Jose and Maqui Maqui are currently underway. Yanacocha’s gold production for 2010 was 1.5 million ounces (750,000 attributable ounces). As of December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 5.0 million ounces of gold reserves. In 2011, Newmont’s board of directors granted approval to develop the Conga Project, located in the provinces of Celendín, and Sorochuco Huasmín districts and Cajamarca district of Encañada. Newmont’s ownership interest is identical to Yanacocha. If all permits are secured, the commencement of production is expected in late 2014 or early 2015.

Boddington. Newmont’s newest Australian asset is Boddington, which is now Australia's largest gold producer. It has been wholly owned since June 2009, when Newmont acquired the final 33.33% interest from AngloGold Ashanti Australia Limited (“AngloGold”). Boddington poured its first gold in September 2009 and commenced commercial production in November 2009. Boddington produced 728,000 ounces of gold and 58 million pounds of copper in 2010. As of year-end 2010, it reported 20.3 million ounces of gold reserves and 2,360 million pounds of copper reserves. Tanami. The Tanami operations (100% owned) include The Granites treatment plant and associated mining operations, which are located in the Northern Territory approximately 342 miles (550 kilometers) northwest of Alice Springs, adjacent to the Tanami highway, and the Dead bullock Soak mining operations, approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of The Granites. The Tanami operations have been wholly owned since April 2003, when Newmont acquired the minority interests. Operations today are predominantly focused on the Callie underground mine at Dead Bullock Soak and ore is processed through the Granites treatment plant. During 2010, the Tanami operations produced 250,000 ounces of gold. As of December 31, 2010, it had a reported 2.0 million ounces of gold reserves. Kalgoorlie.

The Super Pit gold mine During 2010, the Kalgoorlie operations produced 754,000 ounces of gold (377,000 attributable ounces). It reported 3.8 million ounces of gold reserves on December 31, 2010. New Zealand Newmont acquired its Waihi assets as part of the acquisition of Normandy Mining in 2002. The Waihi operation produced 108,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and reported 0.5 million ounces of gold reserves at year-end. Martha. The Martha Mine operations (100% owned) are located within the town of Waihi, located approximately 68 miles (110 kilometers) southeast of Auckland, New Zealand. The open pit mine has operated over historic underground gold mine workings since 1988. Favona. The Favona underground mine began extracting ore at the end of 2006. Batu Hijau, Sumbawa, Indonesia Haul trucks at the Batu Hijau open pit, 2009 Newmont operates the Batu Hijau mine on the island of Sumbawa in the Indonesia in the province of West Nusa Tenggara through its subsidiary company P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara which is a joint venture between Newmont, Sumitomo Corporation and P.T. Pukuafu Indah. Batu Hijau is a large porphyry copper/gold deposit, which Newmont discovered in 1990. Development and construction activities began in 1997 and start-up occurred in late 1999. In 2010, Batu Hijau produced 542 million pounds of copper (269 million attributable pounds) and 737,000 ounces of gold (364,000 attributable ounces). At December 31, 2010, it reported 3,760 million pounds of copper reserves and 3.7 million ounces of gold reserves. In 2008, the Indonesian government threatened to terminate the contract of P.T. Newmont Nusa Tenggara after accusing it of failing to meet its divestment obligations. On April 1, 2009 international arbitrators and its partner sided with Newmont rejecting Jakarta's request to have their contract revoked, which would have forced the company to walk away from the property without any compensation, instead Newmont is forced to sell a 17% stake in an Indonesian subsidiary within 180 days. In 2011, subsidiaries of Newmont and Sumitomo Corporation divested a 7 percent investment in PTNNT. Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (PIP), designated as the buyer by the Indonesian Government, signed a sale and purchase agreement for the shares worth $246.8 million. Nusa Tenggara Partnership B.V., which holds Newmont’s shares in PTNNT – together with shares held by a subsidiary of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan – now owns 49 percent of PTNNT. Of that amount, Newmont will directly own 27.56 percent of PTNNT and has another 17 percent economic interest through financing arrangements with existing shareholders. The Ahafo operation (100% owned) is located in the Brong Ahafo Region of Ghana, approximately 180 miles (290 kilometers) northwest of Accra. Ahafo poured its first gold on July 18, 2006 and commenced commercial production in August 2006. Newmont operates four open pits at Ahafo with reserves contained in 11 pits. Commercial production in the fourth pit, Amoma, began in October 2010. Ahafo produced 545,000 ounces of gold in 2010 and at December 31, 2010, reported 10.0 million ounces of gold reserves. Additionally, Newmont’s Akyem Mine (100% owned) is located approximately 80 miles (125 kilometers) northwest of Accra. In January 2010, Newmont received the mining lease. After close to two years of construction, the Akyem mine commenced commercial production in late 2013. At December 31, 2010, Newmont reported 7.2 million ounces of gold reserves. Other operations Newmont has a 44% interest in La Herradura, which is located in Mexico’s Sonora desert.

Newmont sold the mine in late 2007; it is now owned by Conquest Mining. Bronzewing Gold Mine: View Resources purchased the mine in July 2004 from Newmont for A$9.0 million, a package that also included the McClure mining operation, 8&#160;km west of Bronzewing. Zarafshan: Newmont was part of a joint venture gold project in Uzbekistan, the first major Western investment in the region since the breakup of the Soviet Union. A difficult place to operate, Uzbekistan expropriates the company’s assets in 2006. Kori Kollo: The Kori Kollo open pit mine is on a high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government mining concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A. (“Inti Raymi”), in which Newmont had an 88% interest. The remaining 12% was owned by Mrs. Beatriz Rocabado. Inti Raymi owned and operated the mine. On July 23, 2009, Newmont announced the transfer of its interest in Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., which owned the Kori Kollo gold mine and Kori Chaca gold mine, to Compania Procesadora de Minerales S.A. (""CPM""), a company controlled by Newmont's long-time Bolivian partner Jose Mercado. Minahasa: Newmont owns 80% of Minahasa and the remaining 20% interest is a carried interest held by P.T. Tanjung Serapung, an unrelated Indonesian company. Minahasa is located on the island of Sulawesi, approximately 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometers) northeast of Jakarta. Mining was completed in late 2001 and gold production was completed in 2004. Golden Giant: Newmont's Canadian operations previously included two underground mines. Golden Giant (100% owned) was located approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Marathon, Ontario, Canada, and had been in production since 1985. Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005 with remnant mining and milling production continuing throughout most of 2006. Holloway: Holloway was located approximately 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Matheson, Ontario, and about 400 miles (644 kilometers) northeast of Golden Giant. It was in production since 1996. On November 6, 2006, Newmont completed the sale of the Holloway mine to St. Andrews Goldfields Ltd. resulting in a $13 pre-tax gain. Controversies The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (January 2014) Nevada state tax deductions and Republican Assembly Minority Floor Leader Pete Goicoechea of Eureka County in Nevada (the county where a majority of Newmont's Nevada operations are located) FIN 48 an interpretation of FASB 109 requires companies to analyze the technical merits of their tax positions and determine the likelihood that these positions will be sustained if they were ever examined by the taxing authorities (or litigation). The 76th Session of the Nevada Legislature (2011), over opposition from the mining industry, passed Senate Bill 493, which was one of two controversial mining-related measures. Senate Bill 493 ""...creates the Mining Oversight and Accountability Commission, a seven-member panel to oversee regulations for mining safety and taxation. An amendment to the measure also eliminates the major deductions mining companies may take when calculating net proceeds of minerals taxes."" However, some representatives of the mining industry said that one of the proposed changes would not increase tax collections: ""'If you don’t let us deduct this, we’ll deduct something else.'"" A Newmont Mining Corp. staffer used this argument to win the employee housing deduction, saying employee housing cut travel costs.""  ""A strike...ended on Friday, 6 August, after some 1,500 miners of the PT NNT labour union, affiliated to the Chemical, Energy, Mine Workers’ Union of the Indonesia Workers’ Union, agreed to await an overtime pay judgment from a provincial government. The strike started on 1 August and completely shut US-based Newmont Mining Corp.’s rich Batu Hijau mines and operations on Sumbawa Island. The dispute started some three weeks after the Manpower and Transmigration Ministry of West Nusa Tenggara Province issued an order that management was in arrears on Rp 126 billion (US$13.8 million) in overtime wages to some 1,919 workers dating back to 2008.""  The ""Minera Yanacocha"" gold mine near Cajamarca (Peru) The Yanacocha gold mine in northern Peru is considered one of the largest and most profitable in the world, producing over US$7 billion worth of gold to date. Before 1994 the mine was co-owned by Newmont, Buenaventura (a Peruvian mining company), and Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM), a French government-owned company. This partnership collapsed in 1994 after BRGM tried to sell part of its shares in the company to an Australian company which was a rival of Newmont. Newmont and Buenaventura would both go to court to challenge the trade. Larry Kurlander, then a senior executive at Newmont, claimed the French President Jacques Chirac had sent a letter to then Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori asking him to intervene in the court case in favor of the French owned company. Kurlander had been sent by Newmont to Peru to try to get a favorable outcome for Newmont in the dispute. The legal battle would eventually make it all the way up to the Peruvian Supreme Court. During this period Kurlander acknowledges having met with Vladimiro Montesinos, the Peruvian intelligence chief who has since been found guilty of embezzlement, illegally assuming his post as intelligence chief, abuse of power, influence peddling and bribing TV stations.  However, Kurlander claims that he did nothing illegal and that the French government were taking similar steps in trying to contact Montesinos. The French ambassador to Peru Antoine Blanca denies this, pointing to the fact that Montesinos was on the CIA payroll and thus would naturally side with the U.S-based company. After the fall of Fujimori in 2000 a number of videos Montesinos had taped of himself meeting with several domestic and foreign leaders and offering bribes and accepting them had emerged. In October 2005 Frontline in co-production with The New York Times found a February 1998 recording of a telephone conversation between Montesinos and Kurlander. The following is an excerpt from the tape: Kurlander:...we have a very serious problem in Peru with our company (Newmont) and Minera Buenaventura so I have enlisted the support of some of my friends from a variety of intelligence communities. I need it especially because the other side (the French government) has been acting quite strangely. Montesinos (to interpreter): Tell him that I am perfectly aware of the problem he has and the people he represents have with the French, as well as the problem he has with the judiciary. Kurlander: So now you have a friend for life. I want a friend for life. Montesinos (to interpreter): I thank you very much for what you have just told me and well you already have a friend. Tell him I'm going to help him with the voting. I would like to know the tricky practices of the French. The French Connection! Kurlander: The French Connection! (laughter) ). Newmont is accused of negligently spilling cyanide at its Ahafo gold mine in October 2009, resulting in water contamination and fish kills."

Nielsen_Holdings," Not to be confused with Nielsen Norman Group. Nielsen Holdings N.V. Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;NLSN Industry Media Founded 1923 Founder Arthur Nielsen Headquarters New York City, USA Key people Dave Calhoun (Executive Chairman) Mitch Barns (CEO) Steve Hasker (COO) Products Consumer information Consumer research Market measurement Revenue $6.288 billion (2014) Net income $970 million (2014) Number of employees 40,000 (2014) Website www.nielsen.com Nielsen Holdings N.V. is a US global information and measurement company with headquarters in New York (USA) and Diemen, global information and measurement company that enables companies to understand consumers and consumer behavior. Nielsen measures and monitors what consumers watch (programming, advertising) and what consumers buy (categories, brands, products) on a global and local basis. The company has a presence in approximately 100 countries spread across Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, Middle East, North America, South America and Russia. David L. Calhoun is Nielsen's Executive Chairman and Mitch Barns is Nielsen's Chief Executive Officer. Prior to joining Nielsen in 2006, Dave Calhoun served as Vice Chairman of The General Electric Company and President and Chief Executive Officer of GE Infrastructure, the largest of six GE business units. While the Nielsen brand is most often associated with television ratings, those TV ratings services comprise approximately one-quarter of the company's business and revenues. After substantial work to simplify the company over the last several years, Nielsen today aligns their business into two divisions: What Consumers Buy and What Consumers Watch  Nielsen's Buy division (approx. 55% of global revenues) primarily helps packaged goods companies and retailers (and Wall Street analysts) understand what consumers are buying in terms of categories, brands and products. For example, it is Nielsen's data that measures how much Diet Coke vs. Diet Pepsi is sold in stores, or how much Crest versus Colgate toothpaste is sold. They accomplish this by purchasing and analyzing huge amounts of retail data that measures what is being sold in the store, and they combine it with household panel data that captures everything that is brought into the home. They also can provide insights into how changes in product offerings, pricing or marketing would change sales. Major clients include The Coca-Cola Company, Nestle S.A., The Procter &amp; Gamble Company, Unilever Group and Walmart. What consumers watch Nielsen's Watch division (approx. 45% of global revenues) primarily measures what consumers are watching (and listening to) across some devices: TV, radio, computers, etc. The company measures consumption of programming and advertising across all distribution points. Nielsen's ratings are used by advertisers and networks to shape the buying and selling of advertising. Major clients include CBS, NBC Universal, News Corporation and The Walt Disney Company. Today, these are commonly referred to as ""Nielsen ratings"". The company began measuring television audiences in 1950, at a time when the medium was just getting off the ground. Just as with radio, a sampling of homes across the U.S. was used to develop ratings. This information was collected on a device that was attached to a television that recorded what was being watched. In 1953, the company began sending out diaries to a smaller sample of homes (""Nielsen families"") within the survey to have them record what they had watched. In 1999, Nielsen Media Research was acquired by the Dutch publishing company VNU (Verenigde Nederlandse Uitgeverijen). He renamed VNU as The Nielsen Company in 2007. In 2006, VNU sold its business publications division for €320m (£210m) to venture capital group 3i, which then sold the UK division (VNU Business Publications Ltd) to Incisive Media. On June 17, 2013, Nielsen announced that Onex Corp (TSX: OCX) had completed the acquisition of Nielsen Expositions for $950 million in cash consideration. Nielsen Expositions operated tradeshows in the United States. The company was renamed Emerald Expositions Inc. after the transaction. On February 3, 2014, Nielsen announced the acquisition of Harris Interactive, Inc. (NASDAQ:HPOL). This allowed Nielsen to take ownership of The Harris Poll. Nielsen was a private company from 2006 through 2011. On January 25, 2011 the company listed itself on the New York Stock Exchange and issued an Initial Public Offering (IPO) that raised $1.8 billion in the largest private equity-backed U.S. IPO since 2006. ^ Lynch, Jason Nielsen's New COO Explains Why Total Audience Measurement Is Taking So Long AdWeek.

The company initially operated as a distributor for Japanese shoe maker Onitsuka Tiger (now ASICS), making most sales at track meets out of Knight's automobile. On December 19, 2013, Nike Inc.'s quarterly profit rose due to a 13 percent increase in global orders for merchandise since April of that year. Future orders of shoes or clothes for delivery between December and April, rose to $10.4 billion. Nike shares (NKE) rose 0.6 percent to $78.75 in extended trading. baselayers, etc. for a wide range of sports, including track and field, baseball, ice hockey, tennis, association football (soccer), lacrosse, basketball, and cricket. Nike Air Max is a line of shoes first released by Nike, Inc. in 1987. Additional product lines were introduced later, such as Air Huarache, which debuted in 1992. The most recent additions to their line are the Nike 6.0, Nike NYX, and Nike SB shoes, designed for skateboarding.

Nike recently teamed up with Apple Inc. to produce the Nike+ product that monitors a runner's performance via a radio device in the shoe that links to the iPod nano. While the product generates useful statistics, it has been criticized by researchers who were able to identify users' RFID devices from 60 feet (18&#160;m) away using small, concealable intelligence motes in a wireless sensor network. Nike is hesitant to disclose information about the contract companies it works with. However, due to harsh criticism from some organizations like CorpWatch, Nike has disclosed information about its contract factories in its Corporate Governance Report. Sweatshops Nike has been criticized for contracting with factories (known as Nike sweatshops) in countries such as China, Vietnam, Indonesia and Mexico. Vietnam Labor Watch, an activist group, has documented that factories contracted by Nike have violated minimum wage and overtime laws in Vietnam as late as 1996, although Nike claims that this practice has been stopped. The documentary focused on six girls, who all worked seven days a week, often 16 hours a day. Strike in China factory In April 2014, one of the biggest strikes in mainland China took place at the Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Dongguan shoe factory, producing amongst others for Nike. Yue Yuen did underpay an employee by 250 yuan (40.82 US Dollars) per month. The average salary at Yue Yuen is 3000 yuan per month. The factory employs 70,000 people. This practice was in place for nearly 20 years. Environmental record According to the New England-based environmental organization Clean Air-Cool Planet, Nike ranks among the top three companies (out of 56) in a survey of climate-friendly companies. Nike has also been praised for its Nike Grind program (which closes the product lifecycle) by groups like Climate Counts. Marketing strategy Nike promotes its products by sponsorship agreements with celebrity athletes, professional teams and college athletic teams. Advertising In 1982, Nike aired its first national television ads, created by newly formed ad agency Wieden+Kennedy (W+K), during the broadcast of the New York Marathon. The Cannes Advertising Festival has named Nike its Advertiser of the Year in 1994 and 2003, making it the first company to receive that honor twice.

The company began as a shoe retailer and has since expanded its inventory to include clothing, accessories, handbags, jewelry, cosmetics, and fragrances. Select Nordstrom stores also have wedding and home furnishing departments. There are 323 stores operating in 38 states and Canada, which includes 121 full-line stores and 194 Nordstrom Racks, five Trunk Club clubhouses, two Jeffrey boutiques and one clearance store. Nordstrom also serves customers through nordstrom.com and nordstromrack.com, and its online private sale site, HauteLook. In addition, Nordstrom operates one clearance store, along with two Jeffrey boutiques. Nordstrom, Inc.'s common stock is publicly traded on the NYSE under the symbol JWN. The company announced plans to open six stores in Canada beginning in 2014, Nordstrom's headquarters and flagship store (in former Frederick &amp; Nelson flagship) in downtown Seattle. In 1887, at the age of 16, like many other Swedes in the late 19th century, John W. Nordstrom immigrated to the United States in search of opportunity. He was born in the village of Alvik Nedar Luleå in Northern Sweden. His name at birth was ""Johan Nordström"" which he later anglicized to John Nordstrom. After landing in New York, he first began working in Michigan. As he moved across the country, he worked a series of menial jobs. He was able to save enough money to purchase a 20-acre (81,000&#160;m2) potato farm in Arlington, Washington, near Seattle. In 1897, he joined the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada's Yukon Territory, leaving Seattle. After two years of prospecting, he finally struck gold, but sold his disputed claim for $13,000. Returning to Seattle with his newfound wealth, he married Hilda Carlson and looked for a business venture, finally settling on a shoe store that opened in 1901, called Wallin &amp; Nordstrom. Carl F. Wallin, the co-founder of the store, was the owner of the adjacent shoe repair shop. John and Hilda had five children, three of whom would follow him into the family business, Everett W.(1903), Elmer J. (1904) and Lloyd N. Nordstrom. By the time Wallin &amp; Nordstrom opened their second store in Seattle in 1923, Elmer, a recent graduate of the University of Washington, had enough experience to be placed in charge of its opening. The exterior of a typical Nordstrom department store. This one is the now closed location at The Florida Mall in Orlando, Florida. In 1928, John W. Nordstrom retired and sold his shares to two of his sons, Everett and Elmer. In 1929, Wallin also retired and sold his shares to them. The 1930 grand opening of the remodeled Second Avenue store marked the change of name to Nordstrom. Lloyd Nordstrom subsequently joined the company in 1933, and the three brothers ran the business together for almost forty years. By 1958, Nordstrom had expanded to eight stores in two states but still only sold shoes. Their expansion was based on customer service, deep product offerings and full size ranges. Apparel came with its purchase of Best Apparel of Seattle in 1963. The company's name was changed to Nordstrom Absolute Best in 1969. By 1968, the second generation debated selling the company as Everett neared retirement. Instead, they were convinced by the third generation Nordstroms—Bruce A. (Everett's son), James F. and John N. (Elmer's two sons), together with John A. (Jack) MacMillan (married to Lloyd's daughter) -- to take the company public instead, and allow the cousins to take over the business. In 1971, the company was taken public on NASDAQ under the ticker NOBE (Nordstrom Best). In 1973, ""Best"" was dropped from the company's name, and the store assumed its current name of Nordstrom. The previous Nordstrom logo, in use from 1973 through 1991. By 1975, Nordstrom expanded into Alaska (the only time by acquisition) by purchasing Northern Commercial Company and opened its first Nordstrom Rack clearance store in Seattle. A strong northwest regional retailer with sales already approaching $250 million (making it the third-largest specialty retailer in the U.S.), it opened its first Southern California store at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa in 1978. By the early 1990s, it had opened 26 stores plus Racks in California. Subsequent expansion relied on creating a strongly decentralized regional structure, beginning with the Northeast (Tysons Corner Center, 1988), Midwest (Oakbrook Center, 1991), Southeast (Atlanta, 1998), and Southwest (Dallas, 1996) to which the California stores were added. In a new region, the initial store was used as a base for training and recruitment for subsequent expansion, and was usually backed by its own distribution center. From 1978 to 1995, Nordstrom opened a total of 46 full-line department stores. in 2001 the family reasserted its control, with the sons of Bruce A. (Blake, Erik and Peter) assuming senior roles in the company which they continue to hold. In 1998, Nordstrom replaced its downtown Seattle store with a new flagship location in the former Frederick &amp; Nelson building across the street. At 383,000 square feet (35,600&#160;m2), the downtown Seattle location is the chain's largest store. By contrast, the smallest Nordstrom store (as of September 2008) opened in 1980 in Salem, Oregon and has a total area of just under 72,000 square feet (6,700&#160;m2). 2000–present Nordstrom Rack, the company's off-price clearance store As the stores expanded in size, restaurants were added beginning in 1979, reaching their peak with the then-largest (and most expensive) Westfield San Francisco Centre California flagship store that opened in 1989, that included no fewer than four restaurants as well as an English pub. Recently, the ""Espresso Bar"" from older stores has been discontinued and re-introduced as the ""eBar"" with offering a variety of quick-fix snacks, and an expanded ""hotbar"" drink list. Smaller stores (mostly consisting of two-stories) now have an ""in-House Cafe"", which offers the same menu but with seating. Nordstrom has also revised its four restaurants (found in select stores), the casual ""Classic Cafe"" and ""Marketplace Cafe"", the ""Cafe Bistro"" specializing in brick oven entrees, and the ""Nordstrom Grill"" offering food and alcoholic beverages. The Nordstrom restaurants have similar menus and offer different specials daily. The restaurants offer beer and wine. A Nordstrom Rack store in Hillsboro, Oregon Nordstrom sold its stand-alone boutique chain Façonnable in 2007, though it still offers that label in its lineup. In February 2011, Nordstrom announced the acquisition of HauteLook, an LA-based online retailer that offers flash sales on designer goods. The deal included Nordstrom paying $180 million in stock and a three-year ""earn-out"" payment based on HauteLook's financial performance. Other Canada stores are scheduled to open fall 2016 (Yorkdale Shopping Centre and Eaton Centre in Toronto), spring 2017 (Sherway Gardens in Toronto). For many years, new employees were supposedly given a copy of the Nordstrom's Employee Handbook – a single 5-by-8-inch (130&#160;mm ×&#160;200&#160;mm) gray card containing 75 words. The brief employee handbook was, however a myth.) Nordstrom was No. 36 on the same list in 2008, No. 24 in 2007, No. 46 in 2006 and No. 88 in 2005. Nordstrom was ranked No. 286 (previously 293) on the Fortune 500 for 2007. ^ a b c Nordstrom (JWN) annual SEC income statement filing via Wikinvest ^ ""Nordstrom Inc. 2013 Q3 Quarterly Report Form (10-Q)"" (XBRL).

With headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia, the company operates over 22,000 route miles in 22 eastern states, the District of Columbia, Norfolk Southern's predecessor railroads date to the early 19th century. The three main branches of the current corporate family tree were systems for many years themselves: Norfolk &amp; Western, formed in 1881. Southern Railway System, formed in 1894. Conrail, formed in 1976 from the Penn Central Railroad (1968–1976), perhaps the most controversial conglomerate in corporate history. Penn Central itself was created by merging three venerable rivals — the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR, 1846), the New York Central Railroad (NYC, 1831), and the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad (NYNH&amp;H, 1872) — as well as some smaller competitors. Southern Railway Another early predecessor, the Richmond &amp; Danville Railroad (R&amp;D), was formed in 1847 and expanded into a large system after the American Civil War under Algernon S. Buford. The R&amp;D ultimately fell on hard times and in 1894, it became a major portion of the new Southern Railway (SOU). Financier J. P. Morgan selected veteran railroader Samuel Spencer as president. Profitable and innovative, Southern became in 1953 the first major U.S. railroad to completely switch to diesel-electric locomotives from steam. Norfolk &amp; Western The City Point Railroad, established in 1838, was a 9-mile (14&#160;km) railroad in Virginia that started just south of Richmond — specifically, City Point on the navigable portion of the James River, now part of the independent city of Hopewell — and ran to Petersburg. It was acquired by the South Side Railroad in 1854. After the Civil War, it became part of the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad (AM&amp;O), a trunk line across Virginia's southern tier formed by mergers in 1870 by William Mahone, who had built the Norfolk &amp; Petersburg Railroad in the 1850s. The AM&amp;O was the oldest portion of the Norfolk &amp; Western (N&amp;W) when it was formed in 1881, under new owners with a keen interest and financial investments in the coal fields of Western Virginia and West Virginia, a product which came to define and enrich the railroad. In the second half of the 20th century, the N&amp;W acquired the Virginian Railway (1959), the Wabash Railway, and the Nickel Plate Road, among others. Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) was a 11,000-mile (18,000&#160;km) system formed in 1976 by bringing together several ailing northeastern railway systems into a government-owned corporation. Conrail had become profitable after the Staggers Act in 1980 largely deregulated the U.S. railroad industry. In 1996, CSX bid to buy Conrail. Norfolk Southern, fearing that CSX would come to dominate rail traffic in the eastern U.S., responded with a bid of its own. On June 23, 1997, NS and CSX filed a joint application with the Surface Transportation Board (STB) for authority to purchase, divide, and operate the assets of Conrail. On June 6, 1998, the STB approved the NS-CSX application, effective August 22, 1998. NS acquired 58% of Conrail assets, while CSX got the remaining 42%, including about 7,200 miles (11,600&#160;km) of track, most of which was part of the former Pennsylvania Railroad. NS began operating its trains on its portion of the former Conrail network on June 1, 1999, closing out the 1990s merger era. Operations NS is a major transporter of domestic and export coal. The railroad's major sources of the mineral are located in: Pennsylvania's Cambria and Indiana counties, as well as the Monongahela Valley; West Virginia; and the Appalachia regions of Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. In Pennsylvania, NS also receives coal through interchange with R.J. Corman Railroad/Pennsylvania Lines at Cresson, Pennsylvania, originating in the ""Clearfield Cluster"". NS's export of West Virginia bituminous coal, begins transport on portions of the well-engineered former Virginian Railway and the former N&amp;W double-tracked line in Eastern Virginia to its Lambert's Point coal pier on Hampton Roads at Norfolk. Coal transported by NS is thus exported to steel mills and power plants around the world. The company is also a major transporter of auto parts and completed vehicles. It operates intermodal container and TOFC (trailer on flat car) trains, some in conjunction with other railroads. NS was the first railway to employ roadrailers, which are highway truck trailers with interchangeable wheel sets. According to NS's 2012 Annual Report to Investors, at the end of 2012, NS had more than 30,943 employees, 3,468 locomotives, and 79,082 freight cars. At the end of 2012, the transport of coal, coke, and iron ore made up 26% of the total operating revenue of NS, general merchandise (automotive, chemicals, metals, construction materials, agriculture commodities, consumer products, paper, clay, and forest products) made up 54%, and intermodal made up 20% of the total. Company officers Two NS trains heading east along the Pittsburgh Line The Pittsburgh Line is NS's principal east–west line from the Northeast to the Midwest. Running from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to Conway, Pennsylvania, it once was the core of the Pennsylvania Railroad's (PRR) main line. An average day sees 60 to 110 trains of all types. The line is home to the famous Horseshoe Curve. Beginning at Altoona in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and ending at Conpit Junction in West Wheatfield Township, Pennsylvania, trains must ascend and control their speed down the faces of the Allegheny Ridge, some of the steepest slopes in the Allegheny Range. It is a helper locomotive district. Most common on helper assignments are pairs of new SD40Es (former EMD SD50 units rebuilt at NS's Juniata Shops in Altoona). On heavier unit coal trains, it is not uncommon to see two helper sets put together to create what local railfans call four-bangers. Some trains weigh more than 18,000 tons. For eastbound traffic, road crews often call for a ""helper-ahead"" when they are short on time. Some lesser hills also exist west of Altoona, sometimes warranting westbound helpers to continue to Pittsburgh. For this purpose, a partial bypass of the Pittsburgh Line exists between Johnstown and Pittsburgh. Known as the Conemaugh Line, it runs from Conpit Junction to Federal Street on the North Side of Pittsburgh via a flat, though longer, route along the Conemaugh and Allegheny Rivers, bypassing several steep grades west of the Alleghenies as well as the Pittsburgh passenger station. The Conemaugh Line is used mostly by heavier freights. Chicago Corridor Each of the two companies now owns 50% of a new company known as Pan Am Southern (PAS). PAR's trackage between Ayer, Massachusetts, and Mechanicville, New York, was transferred to PAS, and continues to be operated and maintained by PAR's Springfield Terminal Railway Company subsidiary. NS transferred to PAS cash and property valued at $140 million. Planned improvements to the route include upgrades to tracks and signals and new automotive and intermodal terminals. Yards and facilities Norfolk Southern yard in Croxton, New Jersey near Jersey City, New Jersey Main article: List of Norfolk Southern Railway lines Largely an eastern U.S. railway, NS directly owns and operates 21,300 miles (34,300 kilometres) of track in 22 states. It operates three primary hubs in its system: Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Chicago, and Atlanta and maintains facilities across the Eastern US to facilitate operations, including rail classification yards, intermodal yards, and locomotive shops NS has rights to operate its trains with its own crews on competing railroads' tracks. These trackage rights permit NS to operate as far west as Dallas, Texas, as far north as Waterville, Maine, and as far south as Miami, Florida. NS locomotives also occasionally operate on competitors' tracks throughout the U.S. and Canada due to the practice of locomotive leasing and sharing undertaken by the Class I railroads. Not including second, third, and fourth main line trackage, yards, and sidings, NS directly operates some 21,500 miles (34,600 kilometres) of track. In addition NS has direct control over approximately 38,000 miles (61,000 kilometres).

(May 2008) Air quality and fuel efficiency On January 6, 2005, a NS derailment resulted in a large amount of chlorine and diesel fuel being released into nearby waterways in Graniteville, South Carolina. In addition, a toxic cloud covered the city resulting in the town being evacuated. Federal common carrier laws prevent railroads from refusing to transport chlorine and similar Toxic Inhalation Hazard (TIH) commodities. Local wildlife was killed, many of the local crops and vegetation were contaminated or killed, nine human deaths were reported, and thousands were injured. NS's locomotives are often called ""catfish"" by railfans, as the stripes are said to look like catfish whiskers. EMD GP59 no. 4610 was painted in predecessor Southern colors of green and white with gold trim and was a favorite of railfans. The work was done at the Debutts Yard in Chattanooga, Tennessee during the summer of 1994 and the locomotive received a repaint in the summer of 2004. The locomotive was repainted standard NS black and white in February 2012. The current paint scheme for NS locomotives is black and white, with yellow grab irons and step-edge highlights. Locomotives feature a rearing horse decal enclosed in the ""catfish"" stripes on both the nose and rear, which is consistent with marketing campaigns where NS has billed itself as ""The Thoroughbred of Transportation"". Norfolk Southern painted 20 new-order ES44ACs and SD70ACes in commemorative heritage paint schemes as part of NS's 30th anniversary celebration in 2012 (more info below in the ""Heritage Schemes"" section). Locomotives Historically, NS has only purchased DC traction diesel locomotives, and was one of the last North American AC-traction hold-outs aside from Canadian National Railway. In September 2008, however, NS placed its first order for new AC traction locomotives: 24 GE ES44ACs, numbered 8000-8023, for use as pushers on long-haul coal trains. In the years since, NS has purchased several more ES44ACs as well as over 150 EMD SD70ACes. In an effort to avoid having to order new, EPA Tier 4-emissions compliant locomotives in 2015, NS has taken delivery of several older EMD locomotives from various US Class I railroads, including 9 ex-BNSF ""tri-clops"" SD60M's, 6 ex-ATSF (BNSF) SD75M's, the remaining 12 ex-Conrail SD80MAC's owned by CSX, and a majority of Union Pacific's SD9043MAC's. Norfolk Southern is the only railroad ever to own SD80MAC's and SD90MAC's simultaneously.

Remotec, a subsidiary, is the foremost manufacturer of remote control vehicles for explosive ordnance disposal and hazardous material handling. A UK-based subsidiary, Park Air Systems, provides VHF and UHF ground-to-air communications systems for the civil and defense markets. Northrop Grumman has also worked closely with Antenna Associates, Inc., a leading manufacturer of Identification friend or foe (IFF)/Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) antennas located in Massachusetts. In August 2007, Northrop Grumman acquired Scaled Composites in which it had previously owned a 40% stake. In 2008, Northrop Grumman began working with DHS Systems LLC, manufacturer of the Deployable Rapid Assembly Shelter (DRASH) in New York, as part of the U.S. Army's Standard Integrated Command Post System program. In 1994, Northrop Aircraft merged with Grumman Aerospace, famous for building the Apollo Lunar Module to create Northrop Grumman (NG). In 2002, Northrop Grumman acquired TRW Inc., which had acquired Braddock Dunn &amp; McDonald (BDM) in 1997, and became the Space Technology sector based in Redondo Beach, CA, and the Mission Systems sector based in Reston, VA, with sole interest in their space systems and laser systems manufacturing. The Aeronautical division was sold to Goodrich, and the automotive divisions were spun off and retained the TRW name. There have been 15 acquisitions from 1994-2003 Northrop Grumman and Boeing collaborated on a design concept for NASA's upcoming Orion spacecraft (previously the Crew Exploration Vehicle), but the contract went to rival Lockheed Martin on August 31, 2006. In July 2008, three of four Northrop Grumman employees (Thomas Howes, Marc Gonsalves and Keith Stansell) were freed during Operation Jaque after five years of captivity following their aircraft crash in the Colombian jungle. The fourth employee Tom Janis had been killed by the FARC shortly after the crash in 2003. On March 31, 2011, this was spun off as Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc (NYSE:&#160;HII). From 2013, Northrop Grumman participates in the DARPA Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node (TERN) program, and received $2.9 million for Phase 1 Since 2011, Northrop Grumman's headquarters are in West Falls Church, Virginia (previously Jefferson), unincorporated Fairfax County, Virginia. In 2002, the Bethpage Community Park in Bethpage, New York, owned by the company until the 1960s, was closed due to soil contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). In 1995, Robert Ferro, an employee for TRW Inc., a company Northrop Grumman acquired in 2002, discovered that satellite components manufactured for the U.S. Air Force (USAF) were faulty and likely to fail in operation. TRW suppressed Ferro's report of the problem and hid the information from the USAF, even after a satellite in space equipped with the faulty components experienced serious anomalies. Ferro later sued Northrop Grumman in federal court under the federal whistle-blower law. In 1999, the company was sued for knowingly giving the Navy defective aircraft. This suit sought $210 million in damages and was ongoing as of 2004. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) Violations U.S. State Department investigators found that Litton Industries, a subsidiary acquired by Northrop Grumman in 2000, had provided portions of source code used by guidance and navigation system interfaces aboard Air Force One to a company in Russia in 1998. Northrop Grumman agreed to pay a $15 million fine for 110 violations, occurring between September 1998 and November 1998, of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)."

Nucor is North America's largest recycler of any material and recycled 16.9 million tons of scrap in 2015. Nucor produces steel bars (carbon and alloy steel), beams, sheet / flat rolled steel, plate, steel joists, joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, light gauge steel framing, steel grating, expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh. In addition, through its David J. Joseph Company subsidiary, Nucor also brokers ferrous and nonferrous metals, pig iron and HRI/DRI; supplies ferro-alloys; and processes ferrous and nonferrous scrap. History Nucor's history consists of distinct eras: the Reo Motor Car era, the Nuclear Corporation of America era, the Iverson years (1967–98), the DiMicco era (2000-2012), and the Ferriola era (2013–present). Nucor's origins are with auto manufacturer Ransom E. Olds, who founded Olds Motor Vehicle Company in 1897 (later, as Oldsmobile, to become a part of General Motors Corporation). In 1905, Olds left Oldsmobile and established a new company, REO Motor Car Company, in Lansing, Michigan. Though Olds' products, including the luxurious REO Flying Cloud car and REO Speed Wagon truck, were popular, they were not profitable, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1938. The company initiated liquidation proceedings after the sale of its operations, but a group of dissident activist shareholders, noticing the existence of a usable tax loss, successfully challenged the liquidation in a proxy fight in September 1955, and forced REO to take over a tiny nuclear services company called Nuclear Consultants, Inc. in a reverse takeover. The company was renamed ""Nuclear Corporation of America Inc."", and relocated to offices in the Empire State Building in New York City. Nuclear's attempt to recast itself as a nuclear industry services company was unsuccessful, and it followed the example of other companies in the 1950s and 60s and attempted to become a conglomerate, moving its headquarters to Phoenix, Arizona. It made several acquisitions, including Vulcraft Corporation, a steel joist manufacturer located in Florence, South Carolina. Vulcraft had been founded by Sanborn Chase (no relation to Chase &amp; Sanborn Coffee), who died at an early age, leaving the company to his widow. Nuclear purchased Vulcraft from Chase's widow in 1962 and hired F. Kenneth Iverson as general manager. The conglomerate fared no better than its predecessors and in March 1965 filed for bankruptcy. The Board of Directors fired Nuclear's President (and had to return his private jet to him), but could not find a replacement. Eventually Samuel Siegel, an accountant with Nuclear and friend of Iverson, who had been looking to leave the company, informed the Board that he would remain with the company under two conditions: Iverson would become President and he (Siegel) would become Chief Financial Officer, conditions the Board accepted. Unable to get favorable steel prices from American manufacturers and unhappy with the imported steel available at the time, Iverson (a metallurgist by training) decided to extend Nuclear vertically into steelmaking by building its first steel bar mill in Darlington, South Carolina, in 1968. The company chose to purchase an electric arc furnace, which was far cheaper than the traditional steel blast furnace, with a US $6,000,000 loan secured by all of the company's assets. Production delays and staffing problems caused the stock to drop to pennies but earnings soared in 1971 and 1972. Nucor is highly decentralized in its operations, there are only five managerial levels at Nucor (supervisor/professional, department manager, division general manager, executive vice president, and President/CEO). Most operating decisions are made at the division level or lower. In addition, Nucor claims that its corporate office staff numbers around 75 employees, which may be the smallest number of corporate office employees among major corporations. Performance Based Compensation All Nucor employees, from senior officers to hourly employees, are covered under one of four basic compensation plans (in addition to base pay) which reward employees for meeting certain incentive specific goals and targets: Production Incentive Plan: Operating and maintenance employees and supervisors at the facilities are paid weekly bonuses based on the productivity of their work group, which can average from 80 to 150 percent of an employee's base pay. Department Manager Incentive Plan: Department Managers earn annual incentive bonuses based primarily on the percentage of net income to dollars of assets employed for their division. These bonuses can be as much as 80 percent of a department manager's base pay. Professional and Clerical Bonus Plan: This bonus is paid to employees not on the production or department manager plan and is based on the division's net income return on assets. Senior Officers Incentive Plan: Nucor's senior officers do not have employment contracts. They do not participate in any pension or retirement plans. Their base salaries are set lower than those in comparable companies. The remainder of their compensation is based on Nucor's annual overall percentage of net income to stockholder's equity and is paid out in cash and stock. In addition, Nucor has periodically issued an extraordinary bonus to all employees, except officers, in years of particularly strong company performance. This bonus has been as high as $2000 for each employee. Non-Union culture Nucor's senior officers are not provided traditional ""perks"" such as company cars, executive parking spaces, or executive dining rooms, though in August 2006, the company did purchase a corporate jet for use by senior management. Several programs (such as Nucor's Profit Sharing, Scholarship Program, employee stock purchase plan, Extraordinary Bonus, and Service Awards Program) are not available to Nucor's officers but only to lower-level employees. Each annual report since 1975 has listed the names of every employee; in the 2007 annual report, it took 12 pages to list the names of all 18,000 employees. Technological Leadership Nucor was among the first steel companies in the United States to use electric arc furnaces to melt recycled steel (primarily from junked automobiles). In 2007, Nucor recycled nearly 10 million cars in its production processes, the equivalent of one SUV every four seconds. Currently, Nucor (in conjunction with two foreign-owned steel companies) operates a facility in Crawfordsville, Indiana that continuously casts sheet steel directly from molten steel without the need for heavy, expensive, and energy-consuming rollers. The process (known as Castrip), if successful, would allow an entire mill to be built in 1/6 the space of a 'mini-mill' and at 1/10 the cost of a traditional integrated mill. They call this concept a 'micro-mill'. Nucor has two pilot projects, one in Western Australia and one in Brazil, which are developing low-cost sources of iron for use in its mills."

(August 2015) Autumn 1999 saw the release of the GeForce (NV10), most notably introducing on-board transformation and lighting (T&amp;L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120&#160;MHz and featuring four pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin. Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for Microsoft's Xbox game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project drew the time of many of Nvidia's best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the GeForce2 GTS shipped in the summer of 2000. In 2000, Nvidia acquired the intellectual assets of its one-time rival 3dfx, one of the biggest graphics companies of the mid-to-late 1990s. December 2004 saw the announcement that Nvidia would assist Sony with the design of the graphics processor (RSX) in the PlayStation 3 game console. In March 2006, it emerged that Nvidia would deliver RSX to Sony as an IP core, and that Sony alone would organize the manufacture of the RSX. Under the agreement, Nvidia would provide ongoing support to port the RSX to Sony's fabs of choice (Sony and Toshiba), as well as die shrinks to 65&#160;nm. This practice contrasted with Nvidia's business arrangement with Microsoft, in which Nvidia managed production and delivery of the Xbox GPU through Nvidia's usual third-party foundry contracts. Meanwhile, in May 2005 Microsoft chose to license a design by ATI and to make its own manufacturing arrangements for the Xbox 360 graphics hardware, as had Nintendo for the Wii console (which succeeded the ATI-based Nintendo GameCube). In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice regarding possible antitrust violations in the graphics card industry. On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired PGI from STMicroelectronics. On January 6, 2013, Nvidia introduced at CES 2013, the Tegra 4 mobile processor (codename ""Wayne""), containing 72 GPU cores, a Quad-core ARM Cortex-A15 CPU core, and LTE capability among its features. On February 19, 2013, Nvidia announced the Tegra 4i (codename ""Project Grey""), its first fully integrated 4G LTE mobile processor, featuring 5 times more GPU cores than Tegra 3, 1080p HD support, and Nvidia Chimera Computational Photography Architecture. On January 6, 2014, Nvidia introduced at CES 2014, the Tegra K1 mobile processor (codename ""Logan""), containing 192 GPU cores and a Quad ARM Cortex-A15 MPCore R3 + low power companion core (32-bit) or Dual-core Project Denver (64-bit). As of February 2014, Nvidia claims that the Tegra K1 outperforms both the Xbox 360 and the PS3 hardware. Nvidia shipped an estimated 33 million graphics chips in the first quarter of 2010, for a market share of 31.5%. AMD and Intel shipped an estimated 25.15 million units (24.0% market share) and an estimated 45.49 million units (43.5% market share) respectively. Nvidia's year-to-year growth was 41.9%. In August 2011, Nvidia predicted the growth of its revenues would be 4% to 6%, instead of 4%, as analysts said. Nvidia's product portfolio includes graphics processors, wireless communications processors, PC platform (motherboard core logic) chipsets, automotive solutions and digital media player software. Some of Nvidia's product families are: GeForce, the consumer oriented graphics processing products for which Nvidia is best known. nForce, a motherboard chipset created by Nvidia for Intel (Celeron, Pentium and Core 2) and AMD (Athlon and Duron) microprocessors."

Contents 1 History 2 Expansion 3 Executive Management 4 References 5 External links History An O'Reilly Auto Parts store in Ypsilanti, Michigan O'Reilly Auto Parts in Houston, Texas O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. officially started in the auto parts business with one store in Springfield, Missouri, in December 1957. However, its historical background in the automotive business, as well as the family’s quest for opportunity and advancement, may be traced back to a much earlier time. Michael Byrne O’Reilly immigrated to America in 1849, escaping from the hard times of the potato famine, which struck Ireland in 1845-46. Settling in St. Louis, he worked his way through school to earn a law degree, and then pursued a career as a title examiner. His son, Charles Francis O’Reilly, attended college in St. Louis and went to work in 1914 as a traveling salesman for Fred Campbell Auto Supply in St. Louis. By 1924, Charles had become familiar with the Springfield area, having traveled by train to sell auto parts throughout the territory. He recognized the region as an area of growth and opportunity and asked to be transferred there. By 1932, he had become manager of Link Motor Supply in Springfield, and one of his sons, Charles H. (Chub) O’Reilly, joined the company. Together they provided the leadership and management that made Link the predominant auto parts store in the area. In 1957, Link planned a reorganization, which would have included the retirement of 72-year-old Charles F. O’Reilly, and the transfer of Chub O’Reilly to Kansas City. Since neither agreed with these plans, they made the decision to form their own company, O’Reilly Automotive, Inc. They opened for business on December 2, 1957, with one store and 13 employees at 403 Sherman in Springfield. Their sales totaled $700,000 in 1958, their first full year of business. Due to the hard work and ability of the original employees, several of whom were stockholders in the company, the business grew and prospered from its very first year. By 1961, the company’s volume had reached $1.3 million — the combined volume of O’Reilly Automotive and Ozark Automotive Distributors, a division formed to serve independent automotive jobbers in the area. In March 1975, annual sales volume rose to $7 million and a 52,000 square-foot facility at 233 S. Patterson was built for the O’Reilly/Ozark warehouse operation. By that time, the company had nine stores, all located in southwest Missouri. Expansion Notes ^ a b c d e f g h ""O REILLY AUTOMOTIVE INC 2015 Annual Report Form (10-K)"" (XBRL).

On July 6, 1988, an explosion and subsequent inferno on the Piper Alpha platform, operated by Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) Ltd in the Scottish North Sea, resulted in 167 fatalities in what remains the world's most deadly offshore disaster. In 2011, Occidental sold its oil and gas operations in Argentina to Sinopec, a subsidiary of China Petrochemical Corporation. These assets included proven and probable reserves of 393 million 393&#160;million barrels of oil equivalent (2.40×109&#160;GJ). The process used explosives to create underground chambers (retorts) of fractured oil shale. About 20% was mined out after which blasting was used to fracture oil shale. The commercial-sized retort covered 333 by 166 feet (101 by 51&#160;m) area and had height of 400 feet (120&#160;m). Oil shale was then ignited on the top by external fuel, and air or steam was injected to control the process. As a result, combustion moved from the top to the bottom of retort. During the process four major zones could be identified. In the pre-heat zone air contacted processed hot shale (spent shale) which pre-heated air. In the combustion zone, oxygen in air was used to burn carbon residue in the spent shale. Below this zone, heated gas caused retorting process converting kerogen in oil shale to oil shale gas and shale oil vapors. In the final zone oil and gas were cooled and collected through separation sump and collecting well.

In early 2011, Oxy ceased exploration activities and production operations due to the growing civil unrest in the country and U.S. sanctions. In June 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requested information from Occidental, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips related to the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA), an investment firm controlled by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. In 2008, Occidental was recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency as Production Partner of the Year and in 2009 for Continuing Excellence (5 Years). Occidental is a member of the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC). The WHC has certified the habitat conservation and education programs A school was built on the site, and later a middle-class residential district was built upon the land adjacent to the site. The construction broke through the 4-foot (1.2&#160;m) clay seal containing the waste. In 1968, Hooker Chemical was purchased by Occidental Petroleum. In 1978, residents became concerned about unusual health issues in the Love Canal region, including high rates of cancer and birth defects. This subsequently became a national news story, and in 1980, president Jimmy Carter declared a federal emergency in the area. Residents were eventually relocated, and Occidental paid $129 million in restitution. Further information: Caño Limón – Coveñas pipeline On December 13, 1998, seventeen civilians, including 7 children, were killed when the Colombian Air Force (CAF) dropped a cluster bomb in the hamlet of Santo Domingo, Colombia, after AirScan, Occidental's security contractor, from a private aircraft, incorrectly identified it as a hostile guerrilla target. Groups such as FARC and the National Liberation Army were active in the area. Three employees of AirScan were flying the Skymaster plane from which they provided the Colombian military with the coordinates to drop the bombs. The operation had been planned by the CAF and AirScan at Occidental's complex in Caño Limón. On May 10, 2007, a group of 25 indigenous Achuar Peruvians filed suit against Occidental, demanding clean-up and reparations for environmental damages allegedly caused by Occidental over 30 years. The plaintiffs claimed that the company violated the industry standards and the environmental regulations by dumping a total of 9 billion barrels (1.4×10^9&#160;m3) of toxic oil by-products in watersheds used by the Achuar people to fish, drink, and bathe. This environmental damage was alleged to have caused premature deaths and birth defects. On March 3, 2010, EarthRights International (ERI) argued to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals that the landmark environmental and public health case brought by indigenous Peruvian Achuar and the U.S. NGO Amazon Watch against Los Angeles-based oil giant Occidental Petroleum (Oxy), Maynas Carijano v. Occidental Petroleum, should be litigated in Los Angeles, where Oxy is headquartered. In March 2015, Occidental Petroleum made an out-of-court settlement for an undisclosed sum. The funds will be used for health, education and nutrition projects in five Achuar communities (Antioquía, José Olaya, Nueva Jerusalén, Pampa Hermosa and Saukí) in the Corrientes river basin in Peru’s northern Amazon.

ONEOK was founded in 1906 as Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, but It changed its corporate name to ONEOK in December 1980. ONEOK is a general partner and owns 41.2 percent of ONEOK Partners, LP which is one of the largest publicly traded limited partnerships in the gathering, processing, storage, and transportation of natural gas. It also owns major natural gas liquids (NGL) systems due to the 2005 acquisition of Koch Industries natural gas businesses. ONEOK's Energy Services operation focuses primarily on marketing natural gas and related services throughout the U.S. Energy Services, which derives more than 84 percent of its earnings from the physical marketing business, showed an operating income increase of $26.5 million. Energy Services’ retail business participates in customer gas choice program in Nebraska and Wyoming. On December 22, 2005, The ONEOK Foundation said it would donate $1 million this winter to assist residents in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas with their energy bills. ONEOK's predecessor, Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG), had been headquartered in an Art Deco building on the northwest corner of Seventh Street and Boston Avenue in Tulsa since 1928. In 1982, ONEOK chairman, J. E. Tyree, announced plans to demolish the ONG building and replace it with a new 16-story tower. However, this did not happen. Instead, ONEOK bought the Cities Service Company (later renamed Citgo) in August, 1982. The acquired company already had a project underway to build a high-rise headquarters building at Fifth and Boulder. ONEOK realized that it would be more economical to cap the planned structure at 17 stories and move its headquarters there, rather than to proceed with its original plan. It completed the new black granite and glass tower in 1984. Oklahoma Natural Gas Company headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma built in 1928 Oklahoma Natural Gas Company (ONG) was founded in 1906 by two attorneys, Dennis T. Flynn and Charles B. Ames, who planned to develop the natural gas that was a byproduct of the northern Oklahoma oilfields. ONG incorporated on October 9, 1906, under the laws of Oklahoma Territory. Flynn was president and Ames the secretary. Joined by Chicago entrepreneur, H. M. Byllesby, for whom they worked, they also formed the Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company (OG&amp;E) to bring natural gas from the Cleveland Oil Field to Oklahoma City, using it to generate electric power. Byllesby soon resigned, but Glenn T. Braden and Theodore N. Barnsdall joined ONG. Both were already experienced oilmen. Together, they owned the Osage and Oklahoma Gas Company. Braden had been an executive of Standard Oil Company and Barnsdall an oil producer. Braden followed Flynn as president of the company. ONG continued to build pipelines throughout Oklahoma. By the time Braden retired in 1921, ONG owned over 1,300 miles (2,100&#160;km) of lines and served over a half million customers in 48 of the state's 77 counties. In 1928, it built its noted headquarters building in Tulsa. It reorganized several times, first becoming a Maryland Corporation, then a Delaware Corporation. In February 2014, ONEOK spun off its natural gas distribution companies (Oklahoma Natural Gas, Kansas Gas Services, and Texas Gas Services) into a separate publicly traded company, ONE Gas. Oklahoma Natural Gas, the company that started it all back in 1906, now operates as a division of ONE Gas.

Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle, served as Oracle's CEO from its founding until September 18, 2014, when it was announced that he would be stepping down, with Mark Hurd and Safra Catz to become CEOs. Ellison became executive chairman and CTO. Ellison co-founded Oracle Corporation in 1977 with Bob Miner and Ed Oates under the name Software Development Laboratories (SDL). Ellison took inspiration from the 1970 paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database management systems (RDBMS) named ""A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks."" He heard about the IBM System R database from an article in the IBM Research Journal provided by Oates. Also derived from Codd's theories, Ellison wanted to make Oracle's product compatible with System R, but failed to do so as IBM kept the error codes for their DBMS a secret. SDL changed its name to Relational Software, Inc (RSI) in 1979, Part of Oracle Corporation's early success arose from using the C programming language to implement its products. This eased porting to different operating systems (most of which support C). Overall timeline Oracle Linux – A free Linux distribution supported by Oracle since 2006. 1970s June 16, 1977: Software Development Laboratories (SDL) is incorporated in Santa Clara, California The name Oracle comes from the code name of a CIA project which the founders had all worked on while at the Ampex Corporation. June 1979: SDL is renamed to Relational Software Inc. (RSI) October 1979: RSI actively promotes Oracle on the VAX platform (the software runs on the VAX in PDP-11 emulator mode). 1980s 1981: Umang Gupta joins RSI, where he writes the first business plan for the company and serves as Vice President and General Manager. February 1981: RSI begins developing tools for the Oracle Database, including the Interactive Application Facility (IAF), a predecessor to Oracle*Forms. 1982: RSI renames itself Oracle Systems Corporation in order to align itself more closely with its primary product. March 1983: Oracle Database is rewritten in C for portability and Oracle version 3 is released. April 1984: Oracle receives additional funding from Sequoia Capital. October 1984: Oracle version 4 is released, introducing read consistency. November 1984: Oracle database software is ported to the PC platform. The MS-DOS version (4.1.4) of Oracle runs in only 512&#160;KB of memory. (Oracle for MSDOS version 5, released in 1986, runs in Protected Mode on 286 machines using a technique invented by Mike Roberts, among the first products to do so.) April 1985: Oracle version 5 is released&#160;– one of the first RDBMSs to operate in client-server mode. 1986: Oracle version 5.1 is released with support for distributed queries.

Oracle acquires TCI for its project management software. 1988: Oracle version 6 is released with support for row-level locking and hot backups. The developers embedded the PL/SQL procedural language engine into the database but made no provision to store program blocks such as procedures and triggers in the database&#160;– this capability came in version 7. Users could submit PL/SQL blocks for immediate execution in the server from an environment such as SQL*Plus, or via SQL statements embedded in a host program. Oracle included separate PL/SQL engines in various client tools (such as SQL*Forms and Reports). 1989: Oracle moves its world headquarters to Redwood Shores, California. Revenues reach $584&#160;million. 1990s 1990: In the third quarter, Oracle reports its first ever loss; it lays off hundreds of employees. Ellison hires Michael S. Fields as President of Oracle U.S.A., Jeffrey O. Henley as CFO and Raymond J. Lane as COO. June 1992: Oracle 7 is released with performance enhancements, administrative utilities, application-development tools, security features, the ability to persist PL/SQL program units in the database as stored procedures and triggers, and support for declarative referential integrity. 1993: Oracle releases its ""Cooperative Development Environment"" (CDE), which bundles Oracle Forms, Reports, Graphics, and Book. 1994: Oracle acquires the database-product DEC Rdb (subsequently called Oracle Rdb) from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Oracle Rdb operates only on the OpenVMS platform (also a former product of DEC). June 1, 1995: Oracle Systems Corporation announces the merger of Oracle Corporation into Oracle Systems Corporation. This transaction eliminates the holding company structure and streamlines the operating company, Oracle Corporation, with the public holding company, Oracle Systems Corporation.

Many of the products have been added to Oracle's portfolio through acquisitions. Software Oracle Database Main article: Oracle Database In 2004, Oracle Corporation shipped release 10g (g standing for ""grid"") as the then latest version of Oracle Database. (Oracle Application Server 10g using Java EE integrates with the server part of that version of the database, making it possible to deploy web-technology applications. The application server comprises the first middle-tier software designed for grid computing. The interrelationship between Oracle 10g and Java allows developers to set up stored procedures written in the Java language, as well as those written in the traditional Oracle database programming language, PL/SQL.) Release 11g became the current Oracle Database version in 2007. Oracle Database 11g Release 2 was released in September 2009. This version is available in four commercial editions—Enterprise Edition, Standard Edition, Standard Edition One, Personal Edition—and one free edition—the Express Edition. The licensing of these editions shows various restrictions and obligations that are considered complex. The Enterprise Edition (DB EE), as it is the most expensive of the Database Editions, has the least restrictions—but nevertheless has a complex licensing. The Standard Edition (DB SE) and Standard Edition One (SE1), are constrained by more licensing restrictions, which reflects their lower price. Release 12c has been made available on the first of July 2013. Main article: Oracle Fusion Middleware Oracle Fusion Middleware is a family of middleware software products, including for instance application server, system integration, business process management (BPM), user interaction, content management, identity management and business intelligence (BI) products. Oracle Secure Enterprise Search Oracle Secure Enterprise Search (SES), Oracle's enterprise-search offering, gives users the ability to search for content across multiple locations, including websites, file servers, content management systems, enterprise resource planning systems, customer relationship management systems, business intelligence systems, and databases. Oracle Beehive Main article: Oracle Beehive Released in 2008, the Oracle Beehive collaboration software provides team workspaces (including wikis, team calendaring and file sharing), email, calendar, instant messaging, and conferencing on a single platform. Customers can use Beehive as licensed software or as software as a service (""SaaS""). Oracle also sells a suite of business applications. The Oracle E-Business Suite includes software to perform various enterprise functions related to, for instance, financials, manufacturing, customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP) and human resource management. The Oracle Retail Suite maintains a number of product lines: Oracle Fusion Applications Main article: Oracle Fusion Applications Oracle Social Engagement and Monitoring (SEM) System – Oracle has developed a Social Engagement and Monitoring Cloud service that allows businesses to capture relevant brand conversation from global web and social channels to understand what is being said about their product. The Social Engagement and Monitoring cloud provides the most effective and efficient responses across social and customer experience channels. SEM is able to route correct responses to the right team, member, or customer experience channel to ensure the best customer service. The analysis helps to understand what is important to a business’s customers. It identifies trends, spikes, and anomalies to make real time course corrections. It also can identify brand advocates. The SEM cloud identifies customer intention and interests by analyzing the common ways customers talk about a product or a service.

Oracle Corporation has started Oracle Corporation works with ""Oracle Certified Partners"" to enhance its overall product-range. The variety of applications from third-party vendors includes database applications for archiving, splitting and control, ERP and CRM systems, as well as more niche and focused products providing a range of commercial functions in the areas of human resources, financial control and governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC). Vendors include Hewlett-Packard, UC4 Software and Knoa Software. Main article: Oracle Enterprise Manager Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) provides web-based monitoring and management tools for Oracle products (and for some third-party software), including database management, middleware management, application management, hardware and virtualization management and cloud management. The Primavera products of Oracle's Primavera Global Business Unit (PGBU) consist of project-management software. ORAchk (formerly RACchk) examines software in the Oracle stack and reports on issues. Oracle Corporation's tools for developing applications include (amongst others): Oracle Designer Oracle Developer – which consists of Oracle Forms, Oracle Discoverer and Oracle Reports Oracle JDeveloper NetBeans Oracle Application Express – also known as APEX Oracle SQL Developer Oracle SQL*Plus Worksheet OEPE, Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse. Many external and third-party tools make the Oracle database administrator's tasks easier. Operating systems Software as a Service (SaaS) Platform as a Service (PaaS) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Oracle Consulting – technical and business expert services Oracle Financing Oracle Support Product support: Oracle Corporation identifies its customers and their support entitlements using CSI (Customer Support Identifier) codes. Registered customers can submit Service Requests (SRs) (MOS). Critical Patch Updates: since 2005, Oracle Corporation has grouped collections of patches and security fixes for its products each quarter into a ""Critical Patch Update"" (CPU), released each January, April, July and October. Oracle Configuration Manager (OCM, previously Customer Configuration repository or CCR) gathers and uploads details of the configuration of Oracle software. Oracle Auto Service Request (ASR) automatically creates Service Requests for specific hardware faults on qualified Oracle server, storage, Oracle Exadata, and Oracle Exalogic products. My Oracle Support Community (MOSC) Oracle University (training in Oracle products) In 1990, Oracle laid off 10% (about 400 people) of its work force because of accounting errors. This became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize. Oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice, and also settled (out of court) class-action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings. Ellison stated in 1992 that Oracle had made ""an incredible business mistake."" entering the market for a relational database on UNIX and Windows operating systems. This left the door open for Sybase, Oracle and Informix (and eventually Microsoft) to dominate mid-range and microcomputers. Around this time In November 2005, a book detailing the war between Oracle and Informix was published, titled The Real Story of Informix Software and Phil White. It gave a detailed chronology of the battle of Informix against Oracle, and how Informix Software's CEO Phil White landed in jail because of his obsession with overtaking Ellison. Once it had overcome Informix and Sybase, Oracle Corporation enjoyed years of dominance in the database market until use of Microsoft SQL Server became widespread in the late 1990s and IBM acquired Informix Software in 2001 (to complement its DB2 database). Today Oracle competes for new database licenses on UNIX, Linux, and Windows operating systems primarily against IBM's DB2 and Microsoft SQL Server (which only runs on Windows). IBM's DB2 still dominates the mainframe database market. In 2004, Oracle's sales grew at a rate of 14.5% to $6.2&#160;billion, giving it 41.3% and the top share of the relational-database market (InformationWeek – March 2005), with market share estimated at up to 44.6% in 2005 by some sources. In the market for business intelligence software, many other software companies—small and large—have successfully competed in quality with Oracle and SAP products. Business intelligence vendors can be categorized into the ""big four"" consolidated BI firms such as Oracle, who has entered BI market through a recent trend of acquisitions (including Hyperion Solutions), and the independent ""pure play"" vendors such as MicroStrategy, Actuate, and SAS. regarded the two firms' products as complementing one another, rather than as substitutes. Despite the current SAP partnership with Microsoft, and the increasing integration of SAP applications with Microsoft products (such as Microsoft SQL Server, a competitor to Oracle Database), Oracle and SAP continue their cooperation. According to Oracle Corporation, the majority of SAP's customers use Oracle databases. years, however, competition between Oracle and SAP has increased, and as a result, the rivalry between the two companies has grown, even developing into a feud between the co-founders of the two companies, where one party would frequently voice strong negative comments about the other company. In 2004, Oracle began to increase its interest in the enterprise-applications market (in 1989, Oracle had already released Oracle Financials). A series of acquisitions by Oracle Corporation began, most notably those of PeopleSoft, Siebel Systems and Hyperion. SAP recognized that Oracle had started to become a competitor in a market where SAP had the leadership, and saw an opportunity to lure in customers from those companies that Oracle Corporation had acquired. SAP would offer those customers special discounts on the licenses for its enterprise applications. Oracle Corporation would resort to a similar strategy, by advising SAP customers to get ""OFF SAP"" (a play on the words of the acronym for its middleware platform ""Oracle Fusion for SAP""), Oracle and SAP (the latter through its recently acquired subsidiary TomorrowNow) compete in the third-party enterprise software maintenance and support market. On March 22, 2007, Oracle filed a lawsuit against SAP. In Oracle Corporation v. SAP AG Oracle alleged that TomorrowNow, which provides discount support for legacy Oracle product lines, used the accounts of former Oracle customers to systematically download patches and support documents from Oracle's website and to appropriate them for SAP's use. Oracle Corporation was given a contract by the State of Oregon's Oregon Health Authority (OHA) to develop Cover Oregon, the state's healthcare exchange website, as part of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. When the site tried to go live on October 1, 2013, it failed, and registrations had to be taken using paper applications until the site could be fixed. On April 25, 2014, the State of Oregon voted to discontinue Cover Oregon and instead use the federal exchange to enroll Oregon residents. Main article: Oracle v. Google This section is outdated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (August 2014) On August 12, 2010, Oracle announced a lawsuit against Google concerning patent and copyright infringement of Java in Google's development of Android. Oracle claimed that ""Google’s Android competes with Oracle America’s Java"" and that ""Google has been aware of Sun’s patent portfolio ... since Google hired certain former Sun Java engineers."" On August 31, 2011, The Wall Street Journal reported that Oracle was being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for paying bribes to government officials in order to win business in Africa, in contravention of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). previously co-President (since 2004) and CFO. previously co-President (since 2010).

Its corporate headquarters are in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, in Greater Cleveland (with a Cleveland mailing address). 1927: Parker's reputation for producing reliable, high-pressure connections led aviator Charles Lindbergh to specify Parker fittings for the Spirit of St. Louis' historic first Atlantic crossing. 1935: In the midst of the Depression, optimistic Arthur Parker bought a 500,000-square-foot (42,000 m2) Cleveland auto plant from Hupp Motor Car Company to house his 38-employee company. 1939: Parker Appliance sales reached $3 million. 1943: Parker employed 5,000 Clevelanders, all in defense production. 1945: Company founder Arthur L. Parker died; World War II's end halted defense contracts. With no industrial business, the company faced near liquidation. The founder's wife, Helen Parker, refused to give up, and hired new management, who gradually rebuilt industrial business. Son Patrick S. Parker eventually took control of the company. 1953: Parker made its first acquisition, the Synthetic Rubber Products Company in Los Angeles, California. 1957: An acquisition era is underway. With the acquisition of Hannifin Corporation came new cylinder and valve products and a new corporate name: Parker Hannifin Corporation. 1960: A new International Division was formed to market Parker products abroad. 1964: Shares of Parker Hannifin stock (NYSE: PH) were traded on the New York Stock Exchange for the first time. 1966: Parker Hannifin entered Fortune-500 listing of top companies. 1969: Parker has operations in 10 countries in Europe and Latin America. Pat Parker, the founder’s son, was elected President of Parker and Parker products land on the moon with American astronaut Neil Armstrong. 1976: Parker introduced a new company logo. 1977: Parker sales reached $500 million. 1978: Parker strengthened its position in the aerospace market with the acquisition of the Bertea Corporation, which laid the foundation for future leadership in flight controls, hydraulics, and fuel management systems. 1981: Parker sales reached $1.1 billion. 1983: Parker formed a joint venture in China. 1988: Marking its 70th anniversary, Parker made seven acquisitions and exceeded $2 billion in sales. 1992: Parker globalized its business by forming worldwide products groups. 1994: The first retail store, ParkerStore, opened with the objective to reach the aftermarket and gain a greater customer share. 1997: Parker moved to brand new World Headquarters building in Mayfield Heights, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland. 2000: Parker sales reached $5.4 billion. The company merged with Commercial Intertech, its largest deal at the time, and completed four other acquisitions. 2001: Parker introduced the Win Strategy with the single goal to raise the performance of the company to a higher level. In Europe, Parker acquired several large companies in the fluid power business from 1997 and forward, such as Commercial Hydraulics and VOAC Hydraulics. Parker Aerospace is a longtime Airbus supplier, with special competencies in multifunctional system integration. Parker is partnering with Airbus to develop fuel cell technology as an alternative energy source for on-ground and in-flight electrical power supply. Within this partnership, Airbus will be responsible for the overall aircraft system architecture and technology integration into the aircraft, and Parker will supply the multifunctional fuel cell system and manage different subsystem suppliers. A fuel cell is a device which transforms the energy contained in hydrogen and oxygen into electricity through a direct chemical conversion at a low temperature without moving parts. The exhaust product is water, and in the case of an air-breathing system, oxygen-depleted air. The electricity produced by fuel cells can be cleaner and more efficient than combustion engines, depending on the hydrogen source. In addition, the water and the oxygen-depleted air (inert gas) can be used on the airplane to substitute the water and inerting systems. The objective of the cooperation is the development of a technology demonstrator followed by a joint flight test campaign for the middle of the decade, including operational and infrastructural tests. With Parker Aerospace involved in the project from this earliest phase, industrialization can be considered throughout the development of the process, rather than at the end. Airbus considers fuel cell technology as a key contributor to meeting the ACARE 2020 goals, which foresee the reduction of CO2 emissions by 50%, NOX emissions by 80%, and noise by 50%.

PayPal acquired the VeriSign payment solution in 2005 to expand its e-commerce business and provide added security support. PayPal revenues for Q1 2009 were $643 million, up 11 percent year over year. 42 percent of revenues in Q1 2009 were from international markets. PayPal's Total Payment Volume (TPV), the total value of transactions in Q1 2009 was nearly $16 billion, up 10 percent year over year. PayPal launched an updated app for iOS and Android in 2013 that expanded its mobile app capabilities by allowing users to search for local shops and restaurants that accept PayPal payments, order ahead at participating venues, and access their PayPal Credit accounts (formerly known as Bill Me Later). Lowering its transaction fee for high-volume merchants from 2.2% to 1.9% (while increasing the monthly transaction volume required to qualify for the lowest fee to $100,000) Encouraging its users to recruit non-eBay merchants by increasing its referral bonus to a maximum of $1,000 (versus the previous $100 cap) Persuading credit card gateway providers, including CyberSource and Retail Decisions USA, to include PayPal among their offerings to online merchants. Hiring a new sales force to acquire large merchants such as Dell, Apple's iTunes and Yahoo! Stores, which hosted thousands of online merchants Reducing fees for online music purchases and other ""micropayments"" Launching PayPal Mobile, which allowed users to make payments using text messaging on their cell phones Local restrictions The most analogous regulatory source of law for PayPal transactions comes from P2P payments using credit and debit cards. Ordinarily, a credit card transaction, specifically the relationship between the issuing bank and the cardholder, is governed by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1601-1667f as implemented by Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. 226, (TILA/Z). TILA/Z requires specific procedures for billing errors, dispute resolution and limits cardholder liability for unauthorized charges. Similarly, the legal relationship between a debit cardholder and the issuing bank is regulated by the Electronic Funds Transfer Act (EFTA) 15 U.S.C. §§ 1693-1693r, as implemented by Regulation E, 12 C.F.R. 205, (EFTA/E). EFTA/E is directed at consumer protection and provides strict error resolution procedures. However, because PayPal is a payment intermediary and not otherwise regulated directly, TILA/Z and EFTA/E do not operate exactly as written once the credit/debit card transaction occurs via PayPal. Basically, unless a PayPal transaction is funded with a credit card, the consumer has no recourse in the event of fraud by the seller. It is therefore regulated as a bank by Luxembourg's banking supervisory authority, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF). Prior to this move, PayPal had been registered in the United Kingdom as PayPal (Europe) Ltd, an entity which was licensed as an Electronic Money Issuer with the UK's Financial Services Authority (FSA) from 2004. This ceased in 2007, when the company moved to Luxembourg. PaisaPay makes possible payments from abroad by PayPal account holders to Indian sellers on eBay.in. In Australia, PayPal is licensed as an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) and is thus subject to Australian banking laws and regulations. This section appears to contradict itself. Please see the talk page for more information. (March 2016) The PayPal Buyer Protection Policy states that the customer may file a buyer complaint if he or she did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described. The customer can open a dispute within 180 days (for registered UK residents 180 days, changed 14 June 2014) from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within 20 days from opening the dispute. If the buyer used a credit card, he or she might get a refund via chargeback from his or her credit-card company. However, in the UK, where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections (that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation) under Section 75 Consumer Credit Act 1979, the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via PayPal. EWCA Civ 268 7 and the Bank of Scotland v Alfred Truman (a firm)  583 (QB). This is legal authority that section 75 protection does exist where one has paid on credit card for a product, via an eMoney service. There are also other restrictions in terms of the sale itself, the payment method and the destination country the item is shipped to (simply having a tracking mechanism is not sufficient to guarantee the Seller Protection Policy is in effect). The PayPal Seller Protection Policy does not provide the additional consumer protection afforded by UK consumer legislation (e.g., Sale of Goods Act) and in addition it cannot be enforced in the Courts because PayPal operates from Luxembourg, outside all three of the UK legal jurisdictions. A user account tied to a security key has a modified login process. The account holder enters his or her login ID and password as normal, but is then prompted to enter a six-digit code provided by a credit card sized hardware security key or a text message sent to the account holder's mobile phone. For convenience, the user may append the code generated by the hardware key to his or her password in the login screen. This way he or she is not prompted for it on another page. This method is required for some services, such as when using PayPal through the eBay application on iPhone. This two-factor authentication is intended to make it difficult for an account to be compromised by a malicious third party without access to the physical security key, although it does not prevent so-called Man in the Browser (MITB) attacks. However, the user (or malicious third party) can alternatively authenticate by providing the credit card or bank account number listed on his or her account. Thus the PayPal implementation does not offer the security of true two-factor authentication. It is also possible to use a mobile phone to receive an mTAN (Mobile Transaction Authentication Number) via SMS. In 2015, in a still developing process, 150,000 Spanish card holders had their funds frozen in an apparent fraud case involving a PayPal service provider, Younique Money, which was the de facto administrator of the cards. Previously, PayPal had charged €15 to all its card users without authorization (150,000 users). As of March 2015 most funds have not been returned."

PepsiCo's Latin America Foods (Spanish: Snacks América Latina) operations market and sell primarily Quaker- and Frito-Lay-branded snack foods within Central and South America, including Argentina, Brazil, Peru and other countries in this region. Snacks América Latina purchased Peruvian company Karinto S.A.C. including its production company Bocaditas Nacionales (with three production facilities in Peru) from the Hayashida family of Lima in 2009, adding the Karito brand to its product line, including Cuates, Fripapas, and Papi Frits. and involves the manufacture (and in some cases licensing), marketing and sales of both carbonated and non-carbonated beverages in North, Central and South America. The main brands distributed under this division include Pepsi, Mountain Dew, Gatorade, 7 Up (outside the U.S.), Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice, Sierra Mist, SoBe Lifewater, Tropicana juice drinks, AMP Energy, Naked Juice and Izze. Aquafina, the company's bottled water brand, is also marketed and licensed through PepsiCo Americas Beverages. As of 2010, its partnerships include: Starbucks (Frappuccino, DoubleShot and Iced Coffee), Unilever's Lipton brand (Lipton Brisk and Lipton Iced Tea), and Dole (licensed juices and drinks). The company started a new market strategy to sell their Pepsi Cola product in Mexico, stating that about one third of the population has difficulty pronouncing ""Pepsi"". They started manufacturing and selling their product under the label 'Pécsi', the advertisement campaign features the Mexican soccer celebrity Cuauhtémoc Blanco. This is not the first time it has happened, back in 2009, PepsiCo used the same strategy successfully in Argentina. In addition to the production and sales of several worldwide Pepsi-Cola, Quaker Foods and Frito-Lay beverage and food product lines (including Pepsi and Doritos), this segment of PepsiCo's business markets regional brands such as Mirinda, Kurkure and Red Rock Deli, among others. While PepsiCo owns its own manufacturing and distribution facilities in certain parts of these regions, more of this production is conducted via alternate means such as licensing (which it does with Aquafina), contract manufacturing, joint ventures and affiliate operations. PepsiCo's businesses in these regions, as of 2009, contributed 13 percent to the company's net revenue worldwide. The board of directors is composed of eleven outside directors as of 2010, including Ray Lee Hunt, Shona Brown, Victor Dzau, Arthur C. Martinez, Sharon Percy Rockefeller, Daniel Vasella, Dina Dublon, Ian M. Cook, Alberto Ibargüen, James J. Schiro and Lloyd G. Trotter. Former top executives at PepsiCo include Steven Reinemund, Roger Enrico, D. Wayne Calloway, John Sculley, Michael H. Jordan, Donald M. Kendall, Christopher A. Sinclair, Irene Rosenfeld, David C. Novak, Brenda C. Barnes, and Alfred Steele. On October 1, 2006, former Chief Financial Officer and President Indra Nooyi replaced Steve Reinemund as Chief Executive Officer. Nooyi remained as the corporation's president, and became Chairman of the Board in May 2007, later (in 2010) being named No.1 on Fortune's list of the ""50 Most Powerful Women"" Six months later, the company announced that it was moving to 112 acres (45&#160;ha) of the Blind Brook Polo Club in Westchester County. Headquarters of Pepsi-Cola Venezuela (ES) PepsiCo has maintained a philanthropic program since 1962 called the PepsiCo Foundation, Its activities in regards to the pursuit of its goals—namely environmental impacts of production and the nutritional composition of its products—have been the subject of recognition from health and environmental advocates and organizations, and at times have raised concerns among its critics. As the result of a more recent focus on such efforts, ""critics consider (PepsiCo) to be perhaps the most proactive and progressive of the food companies"", according to former New York Times food industry writer Melanie Warner in 2010. Water usage (India, U.S., U.K.) In 2007, PepsiCo's CEO Indra Nooyi made a trip to India to address water usage practices in the country, prompting prior critic Sunita Narain, director of the Centre for Science &amp; Environment (CSE), to note that PepsiCo ""seem(s) to be doing something serious about water now."" the company (in 2009) replenished nearly six billion liters of water within India, exceeding the aggregate water intake of approximately five billion liters by PepsiCo's India manufacturing facilities. compared to its 2006 water usage. Environmental advocacy organizations including the Natural Resources Defense Council and individual critics such as Rocky Anderson (mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah) voiced concerns in 2009, noting that the company could conserve additional water by refraining from the production of discretionary products such as Aquafina. Pesticide regulation (India) PepsiCo's India operations were met with substantial resistance in 2003 and again in 2006, when an environmental organization in New Delhi made the claim that, based on its research, it believed that the levels of pesticides in PepsiCo (along with those from rival The Coca-Cola Company), exceeded a set of proposed safety standards on soft drink ingredients that had been developed by the Bureau of Indian Standards. On March 15, 2011, PepsiCo unveiled the world's first plant-based PET bottle. The bottle is made from plant-based materials, such as switch grass, corn husks, and pine bark, and is 100% recyclable. PepsiCo plans to use more by-products (of their manufacturing processes) such as orange peels and oat hulls in the bottles. PepsiCo has identified methods to create a molecular structure that is the same as normal petroleum-based PET—which will make the new bottle technology, dubbed ""Green Bottle"", feel the same as normal PET. PepsiCo will pilot production in 2012, and upon successful completion of the pilot, intends moving to full-scale commercialization. PepsiCo, along with other manufacturers in its industry, has drawn criticism from environmental advocacy groups for the production and distribution of plastic product packaging, which consumed an additional 1.5&#160;billion US gallons (5,700,000&#160;m3) of petrochemicals in 2008. These critics have also expressed apprehension over the production volume of plastic packaging, which results in the emission of carbon dioxide. In 2009, Tropicana (owned by PepsiCo) was the first brand in the U.S. to determine the carbon footprint of its orange juice product, as certified by the Carbon Trust, an outside auditor of carbon emissions. Also in 2009, PepsiCo's Tropicana brand introduced a new variation of orange juice (Trop50) sweetened in part by the plant Stevia, which reduced calories by half. In 2010, First Lady Michelle Obama initiated a campaign to end childhood obesity (titled Let's Move!), in which she sought to encourage healthier food options in public schools, improved food nutrition labeling and increased physical activity for children. In response to this initiative, PepsiCo, along with food manufacturers Campbell Soup, Coca-Cola, General Mills and others in an alliance referred to as the ""Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation"", announced in 2010 that the companies will collectively cut one trillion calories from their products sold by the end of 2012 and 1.5&#160;trillion calories by the end of 2015."

In 1944, Perkin-Elmer entered the analytical-instruments business, and in the early 1990s, partnered with Cetus Corporation (and later Hoffmann-La Roche) to pioneer the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) equipment industry. Analytical-instruments business was also operated from 1954 to 2001 in Germany, by the Bodenseewerk Perkin-Elmer GmbH located in Überlingen at Lake Constance, and England (Perkin Elmer Ltd) at Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire. EG&amp;G began in 1931; It was started by two MIT professors, Harold Edgerton and Kenneth Germeshausen in a Boston garage. The company was originally incorporated in 1947 as EG&amp;G. 1999 Modern PerkinElmer traces its history back to a merger between divisions of what had been two S&amp;P 500 companies, EG&amp;G Inc. (formerly NYSE:&#160;EGG) of Wellesley, Massachusetts and Perkin-Elmer (formerly NYSE:&#160;PKN) of Norwalk, Connecticut. On May 28, 1999, the non-government side of EG&amp;G Inc. purchased the Analytical Instruments Division of Perkin-Elmer, its traditional business segment, for US$425 million, also assuming the Perkin-Elmer name and forming the new PerkinElmer company, with new officers and a new Board of Directors. The old Perkin-Elmer Board of Directors and Officers remained at that reorganized company under its new name, PE Corporation. It had been the Life Sciences division of Perkin-Elmer, and its two component tracking stock business groups, Celera Genomics (NYSE:&#160;CRA) and PE Biosystems (formerly NYSE:&#160;PEB), were centrally involved in the highest profile biotechnology events of the decade, the intense race against the Human Genome Project consortium, which then resulted in the genomics segment of the technology bubble. PerkinElmer headquarters in Waltham Recently In 2006, PerkinElmer sold off the Fluid Sciences division for approximately $400M; the aim of the selloff was to increase the strategic focus on its higher-growth health sciences and photonic markets. Following on from the selloff, a number of small businesses were acquired, including Spectral Genomics, Improvision, Evotec-Technologies, Euroscreen, ViaCell, and Avalon Instruments. The brand ""Evotec-Technologies"" remains the property of Evotec, the former owner company. PerkinElmer had a license to use the brand till the end of year 2007. PerkinElmer has continued to expand its interest in medicine with the acquisitions of clinical laboratories, In July 2006, it acquired NTD Labs located on Long Island, New York. The laboratory specializes in prenatal screening during the first trimester of pregnancy. In October 2007, it purchased ViaCell, Inc. with its offices in Boston and cord blood storage facility in Kentucky near Cincinnati. The company was renamed ViaCord. In March 2008, PerkinElmer purchased Pediatrix Screening (formerly Neo Gen Screening), a laboratory located in Bridgeville, PA specializing in screening newborns for various inborn errors of metabolism such as phenylketonuria, hypothyroidism, and sickle-cell disease.

In March 2005 the firm acquired Agis Industries Ltd. (TASE:AGIS), an Israel-based generic pharmaceuticals company in an $850 million transaction. Agis was founded in 1983 by Moshe (Mori) Arkin who developed his father's small drug import business into a multinational generic pharmaceutical company. As a result of the acquisition Arkin owns 9% of Perrigo, and was appointed as Vice Chairman of the company. On 1 March 2010, the firm acquired Orion Laboratories Pty, Ltd. a supplier of over-the-counter (OTC) store brand pharmaceutical products in Australia and New Zealand. The Élan merger allowed Perrigo to reincorporate as an Irish company using Élan's headquarters (although the executive offices will remain in Allegan), lowering its effective tax rate significantly.

Pfizer_Inc.," Pfizer Inc. Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;PFE (component of Dow&#160;30 and S&amp;P&#160;500) Industry Pharmaceutical Founded 1849; 167&#160;years ago&#160;(1849) Founders Charles Pfizer Charles F. Erhart Headquarters New York City, United States Area served Worldwide Key people Ian Read (Chairman &amp; CEO) Products See list Revenue US$48.85 billion (2015) Operating income US$11.05 billion (2015) Net income US$7.74 billion (2015) Total assets US$169.3 billion (2015) Total equity US$71.30 billion (2015) Number of employees 78,300 (2015) Pfizer develops and produces medicines and vaccines for a wide range of medical disciplines, including immunology, oncology, cardiology, diabetology/endocrinology, and neurology. Pfizer's products include the blockbuster drug Lipitor (atorvastatin), used to lower LDL blood cholesterol; Lyrica (pregabalin) for neuropathic pain/fibromyalgia; Diflucan (fluconazole), an oral antifungal medication; Zithromax (azithromycin), an antibiotic; Viagra (sildenafil) for erectile dysfunction; and Celebrex/Celebra (celecoxib), an anti-inflammatory drug. Pfizer was founded in 1849 by cousins Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart in New York City as a manufacturer of fine chemicals. Its discovery of Terramycin (oxytetracycline) in 1950 put it on a path towards becoming a research-based pharmaceutical company. Pfizer has made numerous acquisitions, including Warner–Lambert in 2000, Pharmacia in 2003, and Wyeth in 2009 (the largest of the three at $68&#160;billion). In the 1940s, penicillin became very inexpensive. As a result, Pfizer searched for new antibiotics with greater profit potential. Pfizer's discovery and commercialization of Terramycin (oxytetracycline) in 1950 changed the company from a manufacturer of fine chemicals to a research-based pharmaceutical company. To augment its research in fermentation technology, Pfizer developed a drug discovery program focusing on in vitro synthesis. Pfizer also established an animal health division in 1959 with an 700-acre (2.8&#160;km2) farm and research facility in Terre Haute, Indiana. By the 1950s, Pfizer had established offices in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom. In 1960, the company moved its medical research laboratory operations out of New York City to a new facility in Groton, Connecticut. In 1980 Pfizer launched Feldene (piroxicam), a prescription anti-inflammatory medication that became Pfizer's first product to reach one billion United States dollars in total sales. In this decade, Pfizer grew by mergers, including those with Warner–Lambert (2000), Pharmacia (2003), and Wyeth (2009). On June 26, 2006, Pfizer announced it would sell its Consumer Healthcare unit (manufacturer of Listerine, Nicorette, Visine, Sudafed and Neosporin) to Johnson &amp; Johnson for $16.6&#160;billion. In 2002, Pfizer merged with Pharmacia. The merger was again driven in part by the desire to acquire full rights to a product, this time Celebrex (celecoxib), the COX-2 selective inhibitor previously jointly marketed by Searle (acquired by Pharmacia) and Pfizer. In the ensuing years, Pfizer carried out a massive restructuring that resulted in numerous site closures and the loss of jobs including Terre Haute, Indiana; Holland, Michigan; Groton, Connecticut; Brooklyn, New York; Sandwich, England; and Puerto Rico. Pharmacia had been formed by a series of mergers and acquisitions from its predecessors, including Searle, Upjohn and SUGEN. Searle was founded in Omaha, Nebraska, in April 1888. The founder was Gideon Daniel Searle. In 1908, the company was incorporated in Chicago, Illinois. In 1941, the company established headquarters in Skokie, Illinois. It was acquired by the Monsanto Company, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1985. The Upjohn Company was a pharmaceutical manufacturing firm founded in 1886 in Kalamazoo, Michigan, by Dr. William E. Upjohn, an 1875 graduate of the University of Michigan medical school. The company was originally formed to make friable pills, which were specifically designed to be easily digested. In 1995, Upjohn merged with Pharmacia, to form Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn. Pharmacia was created in April 2000 through the merger of Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn with the Monsanto Company and its G.D. Searle unit. The merged company was based in Peapack, New Jersey. The agricultural division was spun off from Pharmacia, as Monsanto, in preparation for the close of the acquisition by Pfizer. SUGEN, a company focused on protein kinase inhibitors, was founded in 1991 in Redwood City, California, and acquired by Pharmacia in 1999. The company pioneered the use of ATP-mimetic small molecules to block signal transduction. After the Pfizer merger, the SUGEN site was shut down in 2003, with the loss of over 300 jobs, and several programs were transferred to Pfizer. These included sunitinib (Sutent), which was approved for human use by the FDA in January 2006, passed $1&#160;billion in annual revenues for Pfizer in 2010. A related compound, SU11654 (Toceranib), was also approved for canine tumors, and the ALK inhibitor Crizotinib also grew out of a SUGEN program. In February 2011, it was announced that Pfizer was to close its UK research and development facility (formerly also a manufacturing plant) in Sandwich, Kent, which at the time employed 2,400 people. On September 4, 2012, the FDA approved a Pfizer pill for a rare type of leukemia. The medicine, called Bosulif, treats chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a blood and bone marrow disease that usually affects older adults. The deal is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016, subject to certain conditions: US and EU approval, approval from both sets of shareholders, and the completion of Allergan's divestiture of its generics division to Teva Pharmaceuticals (expected in the first quarter of 2016).

Lipitor was developed by Pfizer legacy company Warner-Lambert and first marketed in 1996. Prevnar (13-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine) is a vaccine for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal infections. The introduction of the original, 7-valent version of the vaccine in 1999 led to a 75% reduction in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal infections among children under age 5 in the United States. An improved version of the vaccine, providing coverage of 13 bacterial variants, was introduced in early 2010. As of 2012 the rate of invasive infections among children under age 5 has been reduced by an additional 50%. Norvasc (amlodipine), an antihypertensive drug of the dihydropyridine class. Amlodipine is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, a list of the most important medication needed in a basic health system. Diflucan (fluconazole), the first orally available treatment for severe fungal infections. Fluconazole is recommended as a first-line treatment in invasive candidiasis Zithromax (azithromycin), a macrolide antibiotic that is recommended by the Infectious Disease Society of America as a first line treatment for certain cases of community-acquired pneumonia. Flagyl (metronidazole) is a nitroimidazole antibiotic medication used particularly for anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. It is antibacterial against anaerobic organisms, an amoebicide, and an antiprotozoal. Bottles of the antidepressant Zoloft Zoloft (sertraline), is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It was introduced to the market by Pfizer in 1991. Sertraline is primarily prescribed for major depressive disorder in adult outpatients as well as obsessive–compulsive, panic, and social anxiety disorders in both adults and children. In 2011, it was the second-most prescribed antidepressant on the U.S. retail market, with 37 million prescriptions. Selzentry (maraviroc), an HIV entry inhibitor useful for the treatment of multi-drug resistant HIV infection. Zyvox (linezolid), an antibiotic for the treatment of severe, multi-drug resistant bacterial infections. Lyrica (pregabalin) for neuropathic pain. Sales of Lyrica were $4.6 billion in 2013; the US patent on Lyrica was challenged by generic manufacturers and was upheld in 2014, giving Pfizer exclusivity for Lyrica in the US until 2018.

(August 2011) Pacific Gas and Electric Company Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;PCG Dow Jones Utility Average component S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Electricity Natural gas Founded 1905 Headquarters Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Building San Francisco, California, United States Products Electricity Natural gas Revenue US$ 14.956 Billion (2011) Operating income US$ 1.942 Billion (2011) Net income US$ 858 Million (2011) Total assets US$49.75 Billion (2011) Number of employees 19,424 (2012) Horace A. Miller, Secretary and C. O. G. Miller (Christian Otto Gerberding Miller), President, owned and controlled not only the Pacific Gas Improvement Company but also the Pacific Gas Lighting Company (Pacific Lighting Company). C.O.G. Miller is buried in a Pyramid mausoleum at Mountain View Cemetery, Oakland CA. Horace Miller built an enormous mansion in Piedmont, CA at 445 Mountain Avenue in 1913, designed by Arthur Brown, famous San Francisco architect. In 1888, San Francisco Gas Light built its own water gas plant at the Potrero gas works. The manufacturing of water gas proved successful due to the increased availability of inexpensive petroleum. The company decided to construct a modern gas works with both updated water gas manufacturing technology and a modern coal-gas plant as a hedge against shortages in the supply of oil. Pacific Gas and Electric Company plant in Sacramento, 1912 The San Francisco Gas and Electric Company and the California Gas and Electric Corporation merged to form the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) on October 10, 1905. PG&amp;E began delivering natural gas to San Francisco and northern California in 1930 through the longest pipeline in the world, connecting the Texas gas fields to northern California with compressor stations that included cooling towers every 300 miles (480&#160;km), at Topock, Arizona, on the state line, and near the town of Hinkley, California. With the introduction of natural gas, the company began retiring its polluting gas manufacturing facilities, though it kept some plants on standby. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake By 1931 the Sacramento Street Railway Division operated 75 streetcars on 47 miles (76&#160;km) of track. During this same period, Pacific City Lines and its successor, National City Lines, with funding from General Motors, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California (through a subsidiary, Federal Engineering), Phillips Petroleum, and Mack Trucks were buying streetcar lines and rapidly converting most of them to bus service. This consortium was convicted in 1949 of Federal charges involving conspiracy to monopolize interstate commerce in the sale of buses and supplies to National City Lines and its subsidiaries. The actions became known as the Great American Streetcar Scandal or the General Motors Streetcar Conspiracy. As of December 1992, PG&amp;E operated 173 electric generating units and 85 generating stations, 18,450 miles (29,690&#160;km) of transmission lines and 101,400 miles (163,200&#160;km) of distribution system. In 1997, PG&amp;E reorganized as a holding company, PG&amp;E Corporation. It consisted of two subsidiaries—PG&amp;E, the regulated utility, and a non-regulated energy business. In the later 1990s, under electricity market deregulation this utility sold off most of its natural gas power plants. The utility retained all of its hydroelectric plants, the Diablo Canyon Power Plant and a few natural gas plants, but the large natural gas plants it sold made up a large portion of its generating capacity. This had the effect of requiring the utility to buy power from the energy generators at fluctuating prices, while being forced to sell the power to consumers at a fixed cost. However, the market for electricity was dominated by the Enron Corporation, which, with help from other corporations, artificially pushed prices for electricity ever higher. This led to the California electricity crisis that began in 2000 on Path 15, a transmission corridor PG&amp;E built. With a critical power shortage, rolling blackouts began on January 17, 2001. Bankruptcy The cause of PG&amp;Es bankruptcy is explained in greater detail in the Wikipedia article: California electricity crisis. In 1998, a change in the regulation of California's public utilities, including PG&amp;E, began. The California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) set the rates that PG&amp;E could charge customers and required them to provide as much power as the customers wanted at rates set by the CPUC. In the summer of 2001 a drought in the northwest states and in California reduced the amount of hydroelectric power available. Usually PG&amp;E could buy ""cheap"" hydroelectric power under long term contracts with the Bonneville Dam, etc. Drought and delays in approval of new power plants and market manipulation decreased available electric power generation capacity that could be generated in state or bought under long term contracts out of state. Hot weather brought on higher usage, rolling blackouts. etc. With little excess generating capacity of its own PG&amp;E was forced to buy electricity out of state from suppliers without long term contracts. Because PG&amp;E had to buy additional electricity to meet demand some suppliers took advantage of this requirement and manipulated the market by creating artificial shortages and charged very high electrical rates. The CPUC refused to adjust the allowable electric rates. Unable to change rates and sell electricity to consumers for what it cost them on the open market PG&amp;E started hemorrhaging cash. PG&amp;E Company (the utility, not the holding company) entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy April 6, 2001. The state of California tried to bail out the utility and provide power to PG&amp;E's 5.1 million customers, under the same rules that required the state to buy electricity at market rate high cost to meet demand and sell it at lower fixed price, the state also lost significant amounts of money. The crisis cost PG&amp;E and the state somewhere between $40 and $45 billion. The territory is the fourth letter/space/number of Rate Schedule on bills; ex.: G1 X=Terr. X Code B refers to regular residential customers Code H refers to customers with electrical heat Summer rates apply from April 1 - October 31 for gas Summer rates apply from May 1 - October 31 for electrical charges Rates as of August 2012 Tier 1 rates apply from 0%-100% Baseline = $0.12845/kWh, Tier 2 charges from 101% - 130% of Baseline = $0.14605/kWh (114% Base.) Tier 3 charges from 131% - 200% of Baseline = $0.29561/kWh (230% Base.) Tier 4 charges apply over 201% of Baseline = $0.33561/kWh (261% Base.) Tier 5 charges now apply over 300% of Baseline (same charges as Tier 4) Electric charges are sum of electrical use in each tier. Tiers based on Terr. baselines. The CARE rates are 68% to 28% of regular electrical rates and 80% of gas rates. All territories with less than average baselines are subsidizing those with above average baselines There are only two tiers for natural gas rates: less than and in excess of baseline Gas rates above baseline usage are charged at 160% of baseline rates See:PG&amp;E map of baseline territories set by CPUC Tier 1 (usage up to baseline amount) $0.13230 kWh; Tier 2 (between 101-130% of baseline amount) $0.15040 kWh; Tier 3 (between 131%-200% of baseline amount) $0.30025 kWh; Tier 4 (over 200% of baseline amount) $0.34025 kWh 2015 PG&amp;E electrical rates are: Tier 1 (usage up to baseline amount) $0.16700 kWh; Tier 2 (between 101-130% of baseline amount) $0.19824 kWh; Tier 3 (between 131%-200% of baseline amount) $0.25200 kWh; Tier 4 (over 200% of baseline amount) $0.32088 kWh Territory baselines are set according to areas of the state called ""climate zones"" that have similar climate and energy needs. The California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) must establish a reasonable minimum amount of electricity needed by people for each region, which is called ""baseline"" and is adjusted according to season and type of heating used (electrical or gas). Electrical charges depend on tier baseline and usage above the baseline(s). The first two lowest tiers are limited by state law not to increase more than 1% above the inflation rate, and never more than 5% per year. Because PG&amp;E's cost of service has increased faster than this formula allows, much of the cost increases of the utility are pushed into the higher tiers 3 and 4. The billing cycle baseline is the number of days in the billing cycle multiplied by the baseline usage per day. The total charge is the usage in each tier multiplied by the rate in each tier. For example, if the billing cycle was 30 days and the tier baseline (BL) for your territory (Q) with a summer baseline of 7.5 kWh/da × 30 = 225 kWh (=BL) for the billing cycle. The first tier applies for usage up to the baseline, the second tier applies from (1.30*BL - BL), the third tier applies from (2.00*BL - 1.30*BL) and fourth (and higher tiers) apply for all usage over 2.0*BL. The electric bill in territory Q for 800 kWh in a 30-day billing cycle would be = $28.901Tier1 + $9.49185Tier2 + $69.394Tier3 + $117.46Tier4 = $202.78. As can be seen most of the cost is due to usage in Tier 3 and 4 and energy saving practices or more efficient appliances, lighting, etc. should be considered to reduce usage out of these tiers. Gas charges would be calculated similarly except there are only two tiers, usage below the baseline and usage above the baseline. PG&amp;E profits are not dependent upon sales. PG&amp;E rates are set by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). The profit the CPUC allows PG&amp;E to earn is ""decoupled"" from the amount of natural gas and electricity it sells and its cost of operations. The capital investments made in natural gas pipelines, power plants, and electric transmission wires and from incentives earned by achieving energy efficiency targets set by the CPUC determine allowable rates. Shareholders invest in PG&amp;E because the utility is allowed by the CPUC a given rate of return that supports the value of its shares and allows for dividend distributions to share holders. Because PG&amp;E's rate of return is set at 10.4%, well above the real cost of capital and stock market returns for other companies,it has the incentive to make more capital investments than an unregulated company, and incentives for efficiency in areas such as real estate, information technology, and smart grid projects are limited to non-existent. The CPUC has set up the rates for different territories and types of residential customers. The complicated territory boundaries and ""customer definitions"" have been in place since the 1980s. Like nearly all regulated utilities PG&amp;E does not have incentives to be more cost efficient, give better service etc., in hopes of getting more customers or lowering the price the customers pay. It is unclear whether their territorial based rate structure really saves in energy use as it subsidizes those with high gas and electrical usage with higher than average baselines. Those with less than average baselines pay for this subsidy. One good result of the tiered charges are that there is strong incentives to use solar panels, etc. to lower the electrical usage out of the top tiers rate structure. Paying $0.34 per kWh makes an investment in solar panels etc. pay off much sooner. The prices charged relate to the cost of making, transporting electricity plus an allowed return on invested capital and is adjusted at least annually by the CPUC. New or upgrade facilities have to be approved by the CPUC to get incorporated in the allowable rate structure. The average price of natural gas that PG&amp;E has to pay for, the cost of the distribution system and the cost of long term storage systems is reflected in the bill to the customer. Any additional charges are eventually paid for by the consumer—of course. The average cost of residential electricity for PG&amp;E is about $0.15/kWh (PG&amp;E, 2013). However, this average cost is allocated to customers through a set of complex rate structures, including discount rates for low income customers, and higher rates for customers that use significantly more than average for their climate zone. —the average in the other states is about $0.1151/kWh. Industrial and Commercial users of electricity pay an average of $0.1377/kWh and Agricultural users pay $0.1327/kWh in California. Residential customers consume 31,234 GWh per year. Commercial users consume 32,989 GWh per year, Industrial users 14,804 GWh per year, Agriculture 5,804 GWh per year with the rest (about 1%) an assortment of miscellaneous categories. PG&amp;E has started introducing Prices Per Period (PPP) where the rates vary by the time of day. Usage during peak usage periods costs more and usage at slack periods is at a minimum. This is done to minimize usage during peak usage periods to reduce the cost of adding new peak load generators, brown outs, etc. These plans are well underway with commercial users and will probably soon be introduced to residential customers. PG&amp;E is currently applying a special economic development electricity rate that would offer California counties who are suffering from high unemployment lower energy bills. PG&amp;E's utility-owned generation portfolio consists of an extensive hydroelectric system, one operating nuclear power plant, one operating natural gas-fired power plant, and another gas-fired plant under construction. Two other plants owned by the company have been permanently removed from commercial operation: Humboldt Bay Unit 3 (nuclear) and Hunters Point (fossil). Hydroelectric PG&amp;E is the largest private owner of hydroelectric facilities in the United States including 174 dams. According to the company's Form 10-K filing for 2011, ""The Utility’s hydroelectric system consists of 110 generating units at 68 powerhouses, including the Helms pumped storage facility, with a total generating capacity of 3,896 MW.... The system includes 99 reservoirs, 56 diversions, 174 dams, 172 miles of canals, 43 miles of flumes, 130 miles of tunnels, 54 miles of pipe (penstocks, siphons and low head pipes), and 5 miles of natural waterways."" The single largest component is the Helms Pumped Storage Plant, located at 37°02′13.78″N 118°57′53.63″W﻿ / ﻿37.0371611°N 118.9648972°W﻿ / 37.0371611; -118.9648972﻿ (Helms Pumped Storage Plant) near Sawmill Flat in Fresno County, California. Helms consists of three units, each rated at 404&#160;MW, for a total output of 1,212&#160;MW. The facility operates between Courtright and Wishon reservoirs, alternately draining water from Courtright to produce electricity when demand is high, and pumping it back into Courtright from Wishon when demand is low. The Haas Powerhouse is situated more than 1,000 feet (300&#160;m) inside a solid granite mountain. The company operated the Humboldt Bay Power Plant, Unit 3 in Eureka, California. It is the oldest commercial nuclear plant in California and its maximum output was 65&#160;MWe. The plant operated for 13 years, until 1976 when it was shut down for seismic retrofitting. New regulations enacted after the Three Mile Island accident, however, rendered the plant unprofitable and it was never restarted. Unit 3 is currently in decommissioning phase and scheduled to be fully dismantled in 2015. The spent nuclear fuel is currently stored at the Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI) on the plant site because of the United States Department of Energy's failure to find a suitable alternative to storing or disposing of the spent fuel. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric planned to build the first commercially viable nuclear power plant in the United States at Bodega Bay, a fishing village fifty miles north of San Francisco. The proposal was controversial and conflict with local citizens began in 1958. Built in 1956, there are two conventional fossil fuel (natural gas/fuel oil) units at Humboldt Bay Power Plant that produce 105&#160;MWe of combined output. These units, along with two 15&#160;MWe Mobile Emergency Power Plants (MEPPs), will be retired in the summer of 2010. The Humboldt Bay Generating Station, built on the same site, is set to take the older power plant's place in the summer of 2010. In April 2009, PG&amp;E's Next100 blog reported that PG&amp;E was asking the California Public Utilities Commission to approve a project to deliver 200 megawatts of power to California from space. This method of obtaining electricity from the sun eliminates (mostly) the darkness of night experienced from solar sites on the surface of the earth. According to PG&amp;E spokesman Jonathan Marshall, energy purchase costs are expected to be similar to other renewable energy contracts. which created and gives legal authority to the California Energy Commission, to effectively prohibit the construction of new nuclear power plants. The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed as an intervenor in PG&amp;E's 1978 General Rate Case (GRC), claiming that the company's requests for rate increases were based on unrealistically high projections of load growth. Furthermore, EDF claimed that PG&amp;E could more cost-effectively encourage industrial co-generation and energy efficiency than build more power plants. As a result of EDF's involvement in PG&amp;E's rate cases, the company was eventually fined $50 million by the California Public Utilities Commission for failing to adequately implement energy efficiency programs. Since Darbee took control of the PG&amp;E Company in 2004, PG&amp;E has aggressively promoted its environmental image through a variety of programs and campaigns. Main article: Hinkley groundwater contamination This article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (August 2015) The town of Hinkley, California had its groundwater contaminated with hexavalent chromium from a PG&amp;E natural gas compressor plant resulting in a legal case and a $333 million settlement. As a result of the contamination, many had been born with birth defects, including cleft lip and palate, a missing ear, slight intellectual disabilities and many more. The legal case was portrayed in Erin Brockovich, a drama film released in 2000. However, a study released in 2010 by the California Cancer Registry showed that cancer rates in Hinkley ""remained unremarkable from 1988 to 2008"". An epidemiologist involved in the study said that ""the 196 cases of cancer reported during the most recent survey of 1996 through 2008 were less than what he would expect based on demographics and the regional rate of cancer."" The incident then came under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). On August 30, 2011, the NTSB released its findings, which placed fault for the blast on PG&amp;E. The report stated that the pipeline installed in 1956 that later burst did not even meet standards of that time. On June 27, 2003, PG&amp;E National Energy Group, a unit of PG&amp;E Corporation revised its 2002 Form 10-K/A to reclassify certain offsetting revenues and expenses, which net to zero. PG&amp;E revised its 2002 Form 10-K/A accordingly to reflect the change."

Uruguay) under the Switzerland-Uruguay bilateral investment treaty. The Australian Government announced it would introduce 'Tobacco Plain Packaging Laws' on April 29, 2010. Philip Morris International (PMI), arranged for its wholly owned Hong Kong subsidiary Philip Morris Asia (PMA) to 'takeover' two Australian subsidiaries - Philip Morris Australia Limited and Philip Morris Limited on February 23, 2011. In June 2011, Philip Morris International announced it was using ISDS provisions in the Australia-Hong Kong Bilateral Investment treaty (BIT) to demand compensation for Australia's plain cigarette packaging anti-smoking legislation. British American Tobacco, Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International are taking the Australian government to the High Court of Australia to try to stop the elected government of Australia from introducing plain packaging for tobacco products. The government is doing this to lower the rate of deaths related to smoking. Two challenges to the tobacco plain packaging legislation were heard by the High Court of Australia between 17–19 April 2012: British American Tobacco Australasia Limited and Ors v. Commonwealth of Australia and J T International SA v. Commonwealth of Australia. On 15 August 2012, the High Court handed down orders for these matters, and found that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 is not contrary to s 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 5 October 2012 the Court handed down its reasons for the decision. By a 6:1 majority (Heydon J in dissent) the Court held that there had been no acquisition of property that would have required provision of 'just terms' under s51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 18 December 2015 the Tribunal instituted by the United Nations Commission on International Trader Law (UNCITRAL)issued a unanimous decision (3-0) agreeing with Australia's position that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear PMA's claim. This was due to the fact that PMI used its wholly owned subsidiary PMA to takeover the Australian based PM subsidiaries in order to specifically sue the Australian Government for bringing in Plain Packaging laws. PMI was unable to do this itself as the Australia-United States FTA agreement signed in 2004 did not have any ISDS clauses included - by design.

It debuted as an independent energy company when ConocoPhillips executed a spin-off of its downstream and midstream assets. Taking its name from the 1927 ""Phillips 66"" trademark of ConocoPhillips predecessor Phillips Petroleum Company, Phillips 66 began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 1, 2012, under the ticker PSX. The company is engaged in producing natural gas liquids (NGL) and petrochemicals. The company has approximately 14,000 employees worldwide and is active in more than 65 countries. Founded by Lee Eldas ""L.E."" Phillips and Frank Phillips of Bartlesville, Oklahoma, Phillips Petroleum Co. was incorporated on June 13, 1917. The new company had assets of $3 million, 27 employees and land throughout Oklahoma and Kansas. After discovery of Texas's huge Panhandle gas field in 1918 and the Hugoton Field to its north in Kansas, Phillips became increasingly involved in the rapidly developing natural gas industry. In particular, the company specialized in extracting liquids from natural gas and by 1925 was the nation's largest producer of natural gas liquids. In 1927, the company's gasoline was being tested on U.S. Highway 66 in Oklahoma, and when it turned out that the car was going 66&#160;mph (106&#160;km/h), which was fast at the time, the company decided to name the new fuel Phillips 66. Phillips also had gasoline stations in Canada's western provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan under the name Pacific 66 until the late 1970s. In 1932, the 76 brand, long familiar in the western U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal). In 1946, Phillips purchased the Utah-based Wasatch Oil Co., bringing the Phillips 66 brand to the northern Rocky Mountain states and the far eastern portions of Oregon and Washington. In 1966, Phillips entered the West Coast market by purchasing Tidewater Oil Co.'s refining and marketing properties in that region and rebranding all Flying A distributorships and service stations to Phillips 66. In 1967, Phillips became the nation's second oil company, after Texaco, to sell and market gasoline in all 50 states, by opening a Phillips 66 station in Anchorage, Alaska. However, Phillips' experiment in 50-state marketing was short-lived. The company withdrew from gasoline marketing in the northeastern U.S. in 1972 (although it has been returning; for example, there is a Phillips 66 in Westport, Connecticut and Hadley, Massachusetts, and the Phillips 66 owned 76 gas brand appearing in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania), and sold the former Tidewater properties on the West Coast to The Oil &amp; Shale Corporation (Tosco) in 1976. Today, Phillips 66 primarily operates in the Midwest and Southwest, evidenced by its sponsorship of the Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament dating back to its Big Eight days. Mergers Phillips 66 created a joint venture with Chevron Corporation's chemicals and plastics division in 2000, as well as, acquired ARCO Alaska Inc. from British Petroleum. It purchased Tosco, which included Circle K convenience stores and Union 76 gasoline, in 2001. The 76 brand, long familiar in the western and southern U.S., was created by Union Oil Company of California (later Unocal) in 1932. In 2002, Phillips 66 merged with Conoco to form ConocoPhillips. The merged company continued marketing gasoline and other products under the Phillips 66, Conoco, and 76 brands. However, Phillips 66 Co. licenses the Phillips 66 brand to Suncor Energy for its Phillips 66 branded stations in Colorado. Winged version of logo, used for airplane fuel stations in the U.S., this example being in Hillsboro, Oregon The advertising slogan from circa 1973 until the ConocoPhillips merger was ""The Performance Company,"" promoting not only the performance of Phillips 66 gasoline and other petroleum products, but also innovations with asphaltic materials, fertilizers and other non-automotive products. Other slogans through the years have included: ""Go first-class... go Phillips 66"", ""The gasoline that won the West"", ""Good things for cars and the people who drive them"", ""Hard working gas"", and ""At Phillips 66, it's performance that counts"". Their current slogan (July 2015) is ""Proud To Be Here"". Phillips 66 also was a long-time supporter of PBS programming for most of the 1980s. It provided funding for shows such as A.M. Weather, The Search for Solutions, and Onstage with Judith Somogi. Spin-off In the United States, the company operates Conoco, Phillips 66 and 76 stations. In Europe, Phillips 66 operates Jet filling stations in Austria, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

With headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, PPG operates in more than 70 countries around the globe. By revenue it is the largest coatings company in the world. This section requires expansion. (September 2015) Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company plaque in the plaza at PPG Place Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company was founded in 1883 by Captain John Baptiste Ford and John Pitcairn,&#160;Jr., at Creighton, Pennsylvania. Based in Creighton, Pennsylvania (about 20 miles north of Pittsburgh along the Allegheny River), PPG soon became the United States' first commercially successful producer of high-quality, thick flat glass using the plate process. PPG was also the world's first plate glass plant to power its furnaces with locally-produced natural gas, an innovation which rapidly stimulated widespread industrial use of the cleaner-burning fuel. On 19 December 1968 the company changed its name to PPG Industries,&#160;Inc., to show its diverse offerings. Ditzler Color Company, established in 1902 in Detroit as an automotive color concern, was purchased by Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company (now PPG) in 1928. In the mid-1980s, Cipisa, a Spanish paint company was acquired and renamed PPG Ibérica. The CEO of Cipisa, Pere Nadal Carres became CEO of PPG Ibérica. Based in Glendale, CA, the aerospace business has annual sales of approximately $240 million (U.S.), employs 1,200 people. It manufactures sealants in Glendale, CA, and Shildon, England; coatings and sealants in Mojave, CA; glazing sealants at Gloucester City, NJ; and coatings at Gonfreville, France. The business also operates 14 application-support centres in North America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. In 2007, the company was involved in a lawsuit on failing to disclose a purchase reduction of its two major auto glass customers. On November 5, 2014 PPG closed a deal, to purchase Mexican Consorcio Comex, S.A. de C.V. (“Comex”) for $2.3 billion  Lime Lake Reclamation Project of PPG Industries in Barberton, Ohio, received special awards in the National Beneficial Use of Biosolids Program from Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) region&#160;5 in 1998."

It gradually extended its service territory to a crescent-shaped region of central and northeastern Pennsylvania stretching from Lancaster, through the Lehigh Valley into Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. The company limited its activities to Pennsylvania until deregulation of electrical utilities in the 1990s encouraged PPL to purchase assets in other states. The largest of these transactions was PPL's 1998 purchase of 13 plants from Montana Power (leaving NorthWestern Energy - the buyer of the former Montana Power transmission and distribution systems - vulnerable to high ""spot"" prices on the energy market). This added over 2,500 MW of capacity and was the largest expansion in PPL's history. In 2014, those hydroelectric facilities were sold to NorthWestern.

It is the second tallest building in the Lehigh Valley after Bethlehem's Martin Tower. It is located at the intersection of Hamilton and Ninth Streets in the downtown area of the city. The Plaza at PPL Center In February 2010, the PPL Corporation purchased the naming rights to the venue originally known as PPL Park in Chester, Pennsylvania (which is outside of PPL's service territory), the home stadium of Major League Soccer's Philadelphia Union.

(December 2013) Citizens Bank headquarters in downtown Providence, constructed 1991. In 1988, Citizens accepted a takeover bid from the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), based in Scotland, which used Citizens Bank as a stepping stone into the US market. In the following sixteen years under RBS ownership, Citizens acquired several smaller banks in New England to become the second largest bank in the region. Its 1996 acquisition of First NH Bank saw the Bank of Ireland gain a 23.5% stake in Citizens, which RBS then acquired two years later to resume 100% ownership. Expansion outside New England began in 2001, when RBS purchased the retail banking division of Mellon Financial Corporation in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. In one stroke, this made Citizens Bank the second-largest bank in Pennsylvania, and a major player in both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The sale completed on November 7, 2008. In October 2009, Citizens Bank opened a full-service branch inside a Dunkin' Donuts in Bellingham, Massachusetts. The branch offers teller windows, a full-service automated teller machine (ATM) and Dunkin' Donuts promotions for using the bank's services. Citizens was one of the first banks in the US to use Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology on its ATM cards, via MasterCard PayPass. In late 2009, however, Citizens began reissuing its cards under Visa without the RFID technology."
Priceline.com_Inc," Priceline.com Type Subsidiary Founded 1997 (online 1998) Headquarters 800 Connecticut Avenue, Norwalk, Connecticut Key people Paul J. Hennessy, CEO Parent The Priceline Group Website Priceline.com Priceline.com is an American company and a commercial website that claims to help users obtain discount rates for travel-related purchases such as airline tickets and hotel stays. The company is not a direct supplier of these services; instead it facilitates the provision of travel services by its suppliers to its customers. It is headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, United States. Priceline.com is wholly owned by The Priceline Group. Priceline was founded by Jay S. Walker, who left the company in 2000. Priceline first became known for its Name Your Own Price system, where travelers would name their price for airline tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals and vacation packages. While the purchaser can select a general location, service level and price; the hotel, rental car company and/or airline (as well as the exact location of the hotel and the exact flight itinerary) is disclosed only after the purchase has gone through, with no rights to cancel. Priceline's cut of the proceeds is the difference between the price an individual named and the price charged by the service establishment. More recently, it has added a more traditional model, called Express Deals,where travelers are presented prices but are not told the name of the establishment.) An early ad campaign featuring Shatner had him belt out popular songs in spoken word, in the style of his album, The Transformed Man. He was ""replaced"" in 2004 by his Star Trek co-star, Leonard Nimoy. Shatner still appeared in spots for Priceline, running into Nimoy as his replacement. When that campaign ended, Shatner again became Priceline's sole spokesperson. In 2007, an ad campaign by Butler, Shine, Stern &amp; Partners had Shatner take on the role of the Priceline Negotiator. In commercials that began airing January 22, 2012, Shatner's Negotiator character apparently dies as a bus falls off a bridge and explodes. Priceline does not include resort fee amounts in the bidding. Therefore, it's possible to win a bid for a hotel and then be forced to pay mandatory resort fees (for example, often $25 per night for resort hotels in Las Vegas). Priceline continues this practice despite a 2012 warning to the industry from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). ^ ""Priceline.com Incorporated Rankings"". Hoovers.

Contents 1 History 1.1 Founding and early history 1.2 Name Change and Expansion 2 Business operations 3 Eddie 4 Naming rights 5 See also 6 References 7 External links History 1879 - Bankers Life Association was founded on July 1, 1879 by Edward Temple, a banker from Chariton, Iowa, and five other colleagues. At first, Bankers Life Association provided life insurance (in the form of memberships) to men between the ages of 22 and 55. They had to be in good health and not be employed in any occupation that was considered high-risk. Insurance benefits would also not be awarded if unintentional death was caused by harmful consumption of alcoholic beverages, or the irresponsible use of drugs. 1882 - The number of memberships required the hiring of the association's first employee, John Tibbs, who acted as a General Agent. 1889 - Bankers Life Association had $29 million of life insurance memberships in effect. This required the association to relocate its operations to the Equitable Building in Des Moines, Iowa. Costs were kept at frugal standards. Temple's salary increased to $6,000 in 1890, which was considerably lower than salaries offered by similar businesses. 1909 - After the death of Edward Temple, the Board of Directors voted to reorganize the business into a mutual life insurance company. George Kuhns became president of the company. He employed the use of direct-mail advertising to reach new markets. This brought in $3 million in new sales within the first year. 1925 - The company acquired a small, 500-watt radio station, WHO, with a broadcast range of 150 miles (240&#160;km). George Kuhns saw this tool as a way to increase sales. Bankers Life ran WHO until 1930. 1930 - Prior to the Great Depression, the company was closing in on the $1 billion landmark. The 50th anniversary, which was scheduled to take place on June 1929, was postponed until January 6, 1930. President Gerard Nollen gave a $10 gold piece to every person in attendance as a token of his optimism about the future of the economy. 1939 - Continued growth required the company to relocate its operations to a larger facility. A building was constructed at 711 High Street to house the offices. It was the first building in Des Moines to be fully air-conditioned. 1941 - The company issued its first group health insurance contract. Within the next five years, group health insurance accounted for a third of the business. 1962 - The company ended its policy of terminating new mothers, instead offering them part-time work. They could work from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. between the months of September to June, while their kids were at school. Name Change and Expansion Principal's former logo, used from 1998 to 2016. 1985 - The Bankers Life Company became The Principal Financial Group. 1990s - The company expanded to markets outside of the United States, including Brazil, China, Chile, Hong Kong, India and Mexico. October 23, 2001 - The company filed its initial public offering and became a publicly traded corporation. February 28, 2008 - Nippon Life Insurance announced that it would increase its stake in Principal from 4.3% (11.29 million shares) to 7%, making it the largest single stakeholder. The move was said to reduce the likelihood of a hostile takeover.

These acquisitions included Folgers Coffee, Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals (the makers of Pepto-Bismol), Richardson-Vicks, Noxell (Noxzema), Shulton's Old Spice, Max Factor, the Iams Company, and Pantene among others. In 1994, the company made headlines for big losses resulting from levered positions in interest rate derivatives, and subsequently sued Bankers Trust for fraud; this placed their management in the unusual position of testifying in court that they had entered into transactions that they were not capable of understanding. In 1996, P&amp;G again made headlines when the Food and Drug Administration approved a new product developed by the company, Olestra. Also known by its brand name 'Olean', Olestra is a lower-calorie substitute for fat in cooking potato chips and other snacks. In January 2005 P&amp;G announced the acquisition of Gillette, forming the largest consumer goods company and placing Unilever into second place. This added brands such as Gillette razors, Duracell, Braun, and Oral-B to their stable. The acquisition was approved by the European Union and the Federal Trade Commission, with conditions to a spinoff of certain overlapping brands. P&amp;G agreed to sell its SpinBrush battery-operated electric toothbrush business to Church &amp; Dwight, As of July 1, 2014, the company structure has been categorized into four sectors and five Selling &amp; Market Organizations (SMOs). Sectors Beauty Care Baby, Feminine, and Family Care Fabric and Home Care Health and Grooming SMOs Asia Europe India, the Middle East, and Africa (IMEA) South America North America Management and staff The P&amp;G production logo from 1986 to 2007 Procter &amp; Gamble produced and sponsored the first radio soap operas in the 1930s (Procter &amp; Gamble's being known for detergents—soaps—was the genesis of the term ""soap opera""). When the medium switched to television in the 1950s and 1960s, most of the new serials were sponsored and produced by the company. The serial The Young and the Restless is currently broadcast on CBS and is still partially sponsored by Procter &amp; Gamble. When As the World Turns left the air on September 17, 2010, The Young and the Restless, became the only daytime drama left that is partially sponsored by Procter &amp; Gamble. These past serials were produced by Procter &amp; Gamble: Another World As the World Turns The Brighter Day The Catlins The Edge of Night The First Hundred Years From These Roots Guiding Light Lovers and Friends / For Richer, for Poorer Our Private World Search for Tomorrow Somerset Texas Young Doctor Malone Procter &amp; Gamble also was the first company to produce and sponsor a prime-time show, a 1965 spin-off of the daytime soap opera As the World Turns called Our Private World. In 1979, PGP produced Shirley, a prime-time NBC series starring Shirley Jones which lasted thirteen episodes. They also produced TBS' first original comedy series, Down to Earth, which ran from 1984 to 1987 (110 episodes were produced). They also distributed the syndicated comedy series Throb. Procter &amp; Gamble Productions originally co-produced Dawson's Creek with Sony Pictures Television, but withdrew before the series premiere due to early press reviews. It also produced the 1991 TV movie A Triumph of the Heart: The Ricky Bell Story, which was co-produced by The Landsburg Company. It also produces the People's Choice Awards. In 2013, PGP rebranded itself as Procter &amp; Gamble Entertainment (PGE) with a new logo and an emphasis on multi-platform entertainment production. Sponsorships i.e. BeingGirl.com (launched in 2000), In April 2011, P&amp;G was fined 211.2 million euros by the European Commission for establishing a price-fixing cartel for washing powder in Europe along with Unilever, who was fined 104m euros, and Henkel (not fined). Though the fine was set higher at first, it was discounted by 10% after P&amp;G and Unilever admitted running the cartel. As the provider of the tip-off leading to investigations, Henkel was not fined. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a disease caused by strains of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. Most people have these bacteria living in their bodies as harmless commensals in places such as the nose, skin, and vagina. The disease can strike anyone, not only women, but the disease is often associated with tampons. In 1980, 814 menstrual-related TSS cases were reported; 38 deaths resulted from the disease. The majority of women in these cases were documented as using super-absorbent synthetic tampons, particularly the Rely tampon created by Procter &amp; Gamble. ^ a b c d e f ""2012 Earnings Report, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company"".

Drivers plug a device the size of a garage door opener into the on-board diagnostic (OBD) port of their car. The device records and sends the driving data to Progressive, and Progressive uses that information to calculate the rate. After 30 days, customers find out if they’re eligible for a discount based on that 30-day “snapshot” of their driving habits. At the end of a six-month policy period, Progressive calculates the customer’s renewal discount and customers return the device to Progressive. The company doesn’t take into account how fast the car goes although it does take into account how fast and frequently the vehicle operator brakes. Snapshot is voluntary and customers can opt out at any time. The customer is charged up to $50.00 if they do not return the snapshot device to Progressive should they decide not to engage in the program after receiving it.  (Mayfield Village, Ohio, where the company is based, is a suburb of Cleveland.) In March 2008, Progressive announced its title sponsorship of the Progressive Insurance Automotive X PRIZE and their funding of the $10 million prize purse.

On August 28, 2006, federal and state securities regulators and the Department of Justice announced parallel settlements and a total of $600 million in monetary sanctions against Prudential Securities, Inc. (now known as Prudential Equity Group ) for misconduct relating to improper market timing. During the 1980s and 1990s, Prudential Securities Incorporated (PSI), formerly a division of Prudential Financial, was investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for suspected fraud. In 2010, various media outlets noted allegations that the Prudential Life Insurance Company was manipulating the payout of life insurance benefits due to the families of American soldiers in order to gain extra profits. The company provided life insurance to people in the armed forces under a government contract. Rather than paying the full amount due to the families at once, the company would instead deposit the funds into a Prudential corporate account. These accounts are referred to as 'retained asset accounts' and are essentially an I.O.U. from the company to the payee (in many cases a fallen service members' family). While in early 2010 Prudential was making profits of up to 4.2% in its general account, they paid out 0.5% interest in these non-FDIC insured ""Alliance"" accounts.

PVH_Corp.," PVH Corp. Type Public company Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;PVH S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Clothing Founded 1881 Headquarters Manhattan, New York City, New York, United States Key people Emanuel Chirico Chairman, CEO, Director Revenue US$ 6.043 billion (2012)  Net income US$ 433.8 million (2012)  Number of employees 12,000+ Divisions Tommy Hilfiger Calvin Klein Izod Arrow Website www.pvh.com The Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation, commonly referred to as PVH Corp (NYSE:&#160;PVH), is an American clothing company which owns brands such as Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, IZOD, Arrow, and licenses brands such as Geoffrey Beene, BCBG Max Azria, Chaps, Sean John, Kenneth Cole New York, JOE Joseph Abboud and MICHAEL Michael Kors. It is partly named after Dutch immigrant John Manning Van Heusen, who in 1910 invented a new process that fused cloth on a curve. The history of Phillips-Van Heusen (PVH) goes back in part to Dramin Jones, a Prussian immigrant who founded D. Jones &amp; Sons, which had become the largest shirt-maker in the United States by the 1880s. Separately, in 1881, Moses Phillips and his wife Endel began sewing shirts by hand and selling them from pushcarts to local anthracite coal-miners in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. This grew into a shirt business in New York City that placed one of the first ever shirt advertisements in the Saturday Evening Post. D. Jones &amp; Sons merged with Phillips after Dramin Jones's death in 1903. Later Isaac Phillips met John Van Heusen, resulting both in their most popular line of shirts (Van Heusen) and in the subsequent renaming of the corporation to Phillips-Van Heusen in the 1950s. The Phillips-Jones Corporation received a patent for a self-folding collar in 1919; the corporation released the product to the public in 1921 and it became successful. The first collar-attached shirt was introduced in 1929. The Bass Weejun was introduced in 1936. Geoffrey Beene shirts were launched in 1982. In 1987, Phillips-Van Heusen acquired G.H. Bass. In 1995, the corporation acquired the Izod brand, followed by the Arrow brand in 2000, and the Calvin Klein company in 2002. PVH provides products to many popular department stores, such as Sears, JC Penney, Macy's, MYER, David Jones, Kohl's, and Dillard's, both through its own labels and private label agreements. PVH also sells its products directly to customers through about 700 outlet stores under the brand names Van Heusen, IZOD, and Calvin Klein. These stores will sell the full range of Calvin Klein product at full price, differing from existing outlet stores. The stores will be about 10,000 square feet (930&#160;m2). ^ ""Join Our Team&#160;:: World Locations"". Archived from the original on 2008-02-23.

Quanta_Services_Inc.," Quanta Services Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;PWR S&amp;P 500 Component Founded 1997 Headquarters Williams Tower Houston, Texas Revenue $4.7 billion USD (2011) Quanta Services was founded in 1997 to create an integrated, comprehensive and nationwide network of infrastructure contractors to meet the evolving needs of electric utility and telecommunications companies. With deregulation driving fundamental changes in the electric power industry, the founders anticipated a dramatic expansion in outsourcing of the design, installation, repair and maintenance of power transmission and power distribution networks. The company quickly grew from $152 million in revenue in its first year to more than $2 billion in 2000. In addition to the telecommunications and power industries, Quanta soon started to develop capabilities in natural gas infrastructure, and has also expanded into a variety of specialty services. This includes several non-contracting businesses such as Quanta Technology (consulting), Realtime Utility Engineers (design engineering for power), and Engineering Associates (design engineering for telecom). Colson and PAR In 2001 UtiliCorp United Inc. (now Aquila, Inc.), an energy company with whom PAR had been doing business since the 1950s, began taking steps to gain control of Quanta. On August 30, 2007, Quanta Services acquired InfraSource Services (NYSE: IFS) through an all stock deal. Before the merger, Engineering News-Record ranked Quanta Services as the second-largest specialty contractor in the United States and InfraSource Services as No. 8. Quanta Services has a large number of operating companies that can broadly be classified into Electric &amp; Gas, Telecom &amp; Cable, Wireless, and Ancillary Services.

Today, the company is the leading patent holder in advanced 3G mobile technologies, including CDMA2000 1xEV-DO and its evolutions; WCDMA Main article: Globalstar Beginning in 1991, Qualcomm participated in the development of the Globalstar satellite system along with Loral Space &amp; Communications. It uses a low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation consisting of 44 active satellites. The system is used for voice telephony via hand-held satellite phones, asset tracking and data transfer using mobile satellite modems. The system was designed as a normal IS-95 system, and used the satellite as a ""bent pipe"" or ""repeater"" to transfer cellular signals from the handset to the terrestrial base station. Unlike the Iridium system, which routes phone calls between satellites, the Globalstar satellite must always be able to see both the handset and the base station to establish a connection, therefore, there is no coverage over the Earth's poles where there are no satellite orbits. There is also no coverage in locations where the large Globalstar base stations are not in view (some locations in the south atlantic, for example.) Some of the Globalstar hardware is manufactured by Qualcomm. Like other satellite phone networks Globalstar went bankrupt in 1999, only to be bought up by a group of investors who are currently running the system. Legal issues In July 2009, South Korea's antitrust watchdog fined Qualcomm a record Won260bn ($207m) for ""unfair"" business practices related to its chipset sales, sparking strong protests from the company. The Fair Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of abusing its dominant position in the Korean market for CDMA mobile phone chips by charging higher royalties on handset makers that bought modem chips from its competitors, while offering rebates to customers who bought products mainly from the US group, the regulator said in a statement. In October 2008, Nokia announced it will make a one-time payment of $2.29 billion (US) to Qualcomm as part of its patent agreement with the company. Qualcomm dual-band mobile phone Tracking devices - OmniTRACS is a two-way satellite communications and geolocation trailer tracking technology designed for the over-the-road transport market. As of April 2012, approximately 1.5 million units have been shipped to businesses in 39 countries on 4 continents. Semiconductors - Qualcomm designs various ARM architecture-based CDMA, UMTS and LTE modem chipsets and SoC products under the Snapdragon brand. These chipsets are sold to mobile phone manufacturers such as Kyocera, HTC Corporation, Motorola, Sharp, Sanyo, LG, Microsoft, Sony and Samsung for integration into CDMA and UMTS cell phones. Although a ""fabless"" semiconductor company, meaning Qualcomm does not engage in the actual manufacturing process, the chips the firm has designed are powering a significant number of handsets and devices worldwide, both in CDMA and UMTS markets. As of summer of 2007, Qualcomm is among the top-ten semiconductor firms, after Intel, Texas Instruments, Samsung and a few others. Satellite phones - Qualcomm manufactures some of the handsets used on the Globalstar network. MediaFLO - Qualcomm is the inventor of the MediaFLO system, based upon OFDM, which transmits 12-15 television channels within 6&#160;MHz of spectrum. Qualcomm has standardized the lower layers of this design in TIA, and manufactures chips and software to add this television capability to cellphones. QChat - QChat is a cellular/data 2-way push-to-talk voice communications program. Nextel's original push-to-talk technology operates on the iDen network, but Qualcomm's Qchat push-to-talk operates on the Evolution-Data Optimized Revision A mobile broadband network. Sprint-Nextel's first Qchat phones were released in June 2008. Both iDen and Qchat handsets are sold under the Nextel brand. On November 29, 2009 Sprint issued a statement to PhoneNews.com that there are no new QChat handsets on the product development roadmap, but it will continue supporting its existing QChat subscribers. Qualcomm Gobi - Qualcomm Gobi is a mobile broadband chipset used mainly for cellular data networking and it is also now used in a few enterprise smart phones (e.g. Motorola ES400). It currently is a 3G technology capable up to HSPA on GSM and EV-DO rev.A on CDMA carriers. The Gobi chipset is a microprocessor that can load a specific carrier image so that the device appears to be specifically designed for that carrier's network. Since GSM and CDMA are quite different, and since Gobi devices can switch between them both using the same silicon, their solution is considered to be innovative. Gobi Technology is best suited for large enterprise customers where a single mobile operator cannot serve all of their wireless modem needs since there is not one carrier that was provide the same level of service in all the places they need that service. The Gobi solution allows the IT department to roll out a single module on their laptop builds which can be configured to behave exactly like a device that is locked to the carrier that they want to use in that area. In the United States exactly the same hardware can be used on the CDMA network or the GSM network of their choice. For GSM users that travel out of the United States the Gobi solution can be used to avoid international roaming charges by switching the SIM and the device's carrier image to a local provider instead of incurring the roaming charges. In both scenarios the customer must have different wireless accounts with each provider they wish to use natively. It typically takes 20 seconds for the device to load the carrier image into NVRAM and reset and come back online. Gobi 3000 is the next hardware revision of the Gobi platform and it natively supports HSPA+. The model for Gobi 3000 is different. It is a reference design the OEMs can license and produce their own Gobi 3000 compliant modules with their own extensions. Qualcomm does not sell any Gobi 3000 silicon. The reference design allows the same boilerplate hardware and software components for the basis of OEM chips which allow the OEMs to focus on innovations on the mobile broadband platform rather than getting bogged down with low-level RF implementations. Future Gobi platforms will support LTE natively. Currently, some Gobi 3000 modules support LTE through their own extensions. Mirasol displays - Mirasol displays are the world's first and only reflective, bistable display based on IMOD technology. Qualcomm's mirasol displays use ambient light as their source of illumination and consume almost no power when the image is unchanged. This results in a very low power display solution that is visible even in direct sunlight. HALO - A standard for Wirelessly charging vehicles with relatively high efficiency Operating system - BREW (Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless) is a proprietary cell phone application platform. BREW is designed so that the platform rejects unsigned applications. In order to have an application signed, a developer must pay a testing fee to National Software Testing Laboratories (NSTL), which then can approve or deny the request. This allows carriers to maintain control over the applications that run on their customers' phones. BitPim is a popular open source program which can access the embedded filesystem on phones using Qualcomm MSMs via a cable or Bluetooth. It should be pointed out that signing systems are also used in Apple iOS, Java ME, and signing is often required by carriers and OEMs. Speech codec - Qualcomm has developed an audio codec for speech called PureVoice, Eudora servers - Qualcomm formerly developed and sold email servers for multiple platforms, including WorldMail for Windows and EIMS (Eudora Internet Mail Server) for Macintosh. Qualcomm no longer sells these products. Qualcomm continues to maintain and distribute the popular open-source Qpopper for Unix and Linux. Management &amp; Diagnostic tool QPST (Qualcomm Product Support Tool), QXDM (Qualcomm eXtensible Diagnostic Monitor) — official tool for management (QPST) and diagnostic (QXDM) Qualcomm based devices. Services QChat is a Push-to-Talk (PTT) technology. The QChat software application was developed by Qualcomm Internet Services (QIS) Qualcomm developed QChat to provide a reliable method of instant connection and two-way communication between users in different locations, but operating within the same type of network architecture. Prior to the existence of cellular and personal communications services networks, this type of communication was limited to private Land Mobile Radio System (LMR) technology used by public safety and utility service agencies. QChat, an application developed for the BREW platform, is a PTT communication technology for 3G networks. QChat handsets and server software allow users to connect instantaneously with other QChat users anywhere in the world with the push of a button. In addition, QChat enables one-to-one (private) and one-to-many (group) calls over the 3G networks. QChat uses standard Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies. VoIP is a voice delivery mechanism that uses the Internet Protocol to manage the delivery of voice information. Voice information is sent in digital form over IP-based data networks (including CDMA) in discrete packets rather than traditional circuit-switched protocols such those used in the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Functionality QChat users on 3G wireless devices can connect to each other worldwide, in either private or group calls, with the push of a button. QChat uses Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technologies to allow subscribers to communicate by using a PTT button on the handset instead of making a standard cellular call. QChat calls are created by combining separate point-to-point connections between each IP endpoint; the process is managed by the QChat Applications Server, which is deployed on the carrier's IP-based Wide Area Network (WAN). To initiate a call, a user presses the PTT button and receives an immediate indication of whether the call recipient is available. If he or she is, the caller can begin speaking immediately. If the recipient is unavailable, the caller will simply hear a negative response tone instead of a busy signal or voicemail.

However, geologist William Zagorski, who worked for the company, used the knowledge of fracking gained working in the Barnett Shale (pioneered in the region by Mitchell Energy &amp; Development) to attempt fracking in Appalachia, where according Ventura, ""it worked on the first try"". This American Life and the New York Times investigated the company's operations in Amwell Township and Mount Pleasant Township, Washington County, Pennsylvania. Journalists Eliza Griswold and Sarah Koenig found allegations that gas wells owned by Range Resources caused water pollution and air pollution. Residents complained of black running water that corroded faucets and household machinery, showers smelling of ""rotten eggs"" (hydrogen sulfide) and diarrhea, ""mysterious stomach pains"", extreme fatigue or anemia. Medical tests of residents complaining of headaches, nosebleeds and the inability to concentrate showed elevated blood levels of organic solvents and heavy metals such as toluene and arsenic. When presented with such complaints, Range Resources argued that its labs' test results show that complaints of illness and dying animals were not caused by its activities and instead had other causes. In 2010, the Environmental Protection Agency issued an emergency order against Range, stating that the company's drilling activities in Parker County, Texas had led to the contamination of at least two residential drinking water wells. The company denied the allegations, and said the presence of methane was a result of naturally occurring migration, and had shown up in nearby water wells long before Range drilled its gas wells. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said that natural gas drilling by the company has contributed to the contamination of at least two residential drinking water wells in the county and ordered it to step in immediately. ""Based on our findings to date, it's very clear that our activities have not had any impact on the water aquifer in southern Parker county or the subject water wells,"" Range Resources said in a statement. The company said its investigations revealed that methane in the aquifer existed long before its drilling and likely is a naturally occurring migration from several shallow gas zones immediately below the water aquifer."

The company's first product was a gaseous (helium) rectifier that was based on Charles Smith's earlier astronomical research of the star Zeta Puppis.) and was used in a battery eliminator, a type of radio-receiver power supply that plugged into the power grid in place of large batteries. This made it possible to convert household alternating current to direct current for radios and thus eliminate the need for expensive, short-lived batteries. In 1925, the company changed its name to Raytheon Manufacturing Company and began marketing its rectifier, under the Raytheon brand name, with great commercial success. In 1928 Raytheon merged with Q.R.S. Company, an American manufacturer of electron tubes and switches, to form the successor of the same name, Raytheon Manufacturing Company. In 1933 it diversified by acquiring Acme-Delta Company, a producer of transformers, power equipment, and electronic auto parts. By the 1930s, it had already grown to become one of the world's largest vacuum tube manufacturing companies. During World War II Early in World War II, physicists in the United Kingdom invented the magnetron, a specialized microwave-generating electron tube that markedly improved the capability of radar to detect enemy aircraft. American companies were then sought by the US government to perfect and mass-produce the magnetron for ground-based, airborne, and shipborne radar systems, and, with support from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Radiation Laboratory (recently formed to investigate microwave radar), Raytheon received a contract to build the devices. Within a few months of being awarded the contract, Raytheon had already begun to mass manufacture magnetron tubes for use in radar sets and then complete radar systems. At war's end in 1945 the company was responsible for about 80 percent of all magnetrons manufactured. During the war Raytheon also pioneered the production of shipboard radar systems, particularly for submarine detection. Raytheon ranked 71st among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts. In 1945, the company expanded its electronics capability through acquisitions that included the Submarine Signal Company (founded in 1901), a leading manufacturer of maritime safety equipment. With its broadened capabilities, Raytheon developed the first guidance system for a missile that could intercept a flying target. In 1948, Raytheon began to manufacture guided missiles. In 1950, its Lark missile became the first such weapon to destroy a target aircraft in flight. Raytheon then received military contracts to develop the air-to-air Sparrow and ground-to-air Hawk missiles—projects that received impetus from the Korean War. In later decades, it remained a major producer of missiles, among them the Patriot antimissile missile and the air-to-air Phoenix missile. In 1959, Raytheon acquired the marine electronics company Apelco Applied Electronics, which significantly increased its strength in commercial marine navigation and radio gear, as well as less-expensive Japanese suppliers of products such as marine/weather band radios and direction-finding gear. In the same year, it changed its name to Raytheon Company. During the post-war years, Raytheon also made generally low- to medium-powered radio and television transmitters and related equipment for the commercial market, but the high-powered market was solidly in the hands of larger, better financed competitors such as Continental Electronics, General Electric and Radio Corporation of America, in the US and got into the educational publishing business with the acquisition of D.C. Heath. In the 1950s, Raytheon began manufacturing transistors, including the CK722, priced and marketed to hobbyists. In 1961, the British electronics company A.C. Cossor merged with Raytheon, following its sale by Philips. The new Company's name was Raytheon Cossor. The Cossor side of the organisation is still current in the Raytheon group as of 2010. In 1965, it acquired Amana Refrigeration, Inc., a manufacturer of refrigerators and air conditioners. Using the Amana brand name and its distribution channels, Raytheon began selling the first countertop household microwave oven in 1967 and became a dominant manufacturer in the microwave oven business. 1980s In 1980, Raytheon acquired Beech Aircraft Corporation, a leading manufacturer of general aviation aircraft founded in 1932 by Walter H. Beech. In 1993 the company expanded its aircraft activities by adding the Hawker line of business jets by acquiring Corporate Jets Inc., the business jet product line of British Aerospace (now BAE Systems). These two entities were merged in 1994 to become the Raytheon Aircraft Company. In the first quarter of 2007 Raytheon sold its aircraft operations, which subsequently operated as Hawker Beechcraft, and since 2014 have been units of Textron Aviation. The product line of Raytheon's aircraft subsidiary included business jets such as the Hawker 800XP and Hawker 4000, the Beechjet 400A, and the Premier I; the popular King Air series of twin turboprops; and piston-engine aircraft such as the Bonanza. Its special-mission aircraft included the single-turboprop T-6A Texan II, which the United States Air Force and United States Navy had chosen as their primary training aircraft. 1990s In 1991, during the Persian Gulf War, Raytheon's Patriot missile received great international exposure, resulting in a substantial increase in sales for the company outside the United States. In an effort to establish leadership in the defense electronics business, Raytheon purchased in quick succession Dallas-based E-Systems (1995), Chrysler Corporation's defense electronics and aircraft-modification businesses, which had previously acquired companies such as Electrospace systems (1996) (portions of these businesses were later sold to L-3 Communications), and the defense unit of Texas Instruments—Defense Systems &amp; Electronics Group (1997). Also in 1997, Raytheon acquired the aerospace and defense business of Hughes Aircraft Company from Hughes Electronics Corporation—a subsidiary of General Motors, which included a number of product lines previously purchased by Hughes Electronics including the former General Dynamics missile business (Pomona facility), the defense portion of Delco Electronics (Delco Systems Operations), and Magnavox Electronic Systems. Raytheon also divested itself of several nondefense businesses in the 1990s, including Amana Refrigeration and Seismograph Service Ltd (sold to Schlumberger-Geco-Prakla). On October 12, 1999 Raytheon exited the personal rapid transit (PRT) business as it terminated its PRT 2000 In December 2010, AST(Applied Signal Technology) agreed to be acquired by military contractor Raytheon for $490 million. Raytheon’s businesses are supported by several dedicated international operations including: Raytheon Australia; Raytheon Canada Limited; operations in Japan; Raytheon Microelectronics in Spain; Raytheon UK (formerly Raytheon Systems Limited); and ThalesRaytheonSystems, France. Strategic Business Areas In recent years, Raytheon has expanded into other fields while redefining some of its core business activities. Raytheon has identified four key 'Strategic Business Areas' where it is focusing its expertise and resources, including: Homeland Security Missile Defense Precision Engagement Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR) Process Improvement (Raytheon Lean6) Leadership A PAVE PAWS Early Warning Radar System built by Raytheon, based at Clear AFS, Alaska Raytheon is a developer and manufacturer of radars (including AESAs), electro-optical sensors, and other advanced electronics systems for airborne, naval and ground based military applications. Examples include: APG-63/APG-70 radars for the F-15 Eagle APG-65/APG-73/APG-79 radars for the F/A-18 Hornet APG-77 radar for the F-22 Raptor (joint development with Northrop Grumman ) ALE-50 towed decoy ALR-67(V)3 and ALR-69A radar warning receivers AN/APQ-181 (AESA upgrade currently in development), for the B-2 Spirit bomber Integrated Sensor Suite (ISS) for the RQ-4 Global Hawk UAV ASQ-228 ATFLIR (Advanced Targeting Forward-Looking Infrared) pod TPQ-36/TPQ-37 Firefinder and MPQ-64 Sentinel mobile battlefield radars F-16 RACR Designed for the F-16 using AESA technology SLQ-32 shipboard EW system Large fixed-site radars such as PAVE PAWS, BMEWS, and the Missile Defense Agency X-band Radar (XBR) Satellite sensors Raytheon, often in conjunction with Boeing, Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman, is also heavily involved in the satellite sensor business. Much of its Space and Airborne Systems division in El Segundo, CA is devoted to this, a business it inherited from Hughes. Examples of programs include: Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS), being developed for the Ballistic Missile Defense. Raytheon is building the sensor payload. Additionally, the El Segundo site is the company center of excellence for the development and production of laser products. Raytheon company's Navy Multiband Terminal (NMT) is the first advanced, next-generation satellite communications (SATCOM) system to successfully log on to and communicate with the U.S. government's Milstar SATCOM system using low and medium data rate waveforms. The system provides naval commanders and sailors with greater data capacity, as well as improved protection against enemy intercept and jamming. Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), was developed by Raytheon Space and Airborne Sensors and is currently in operation on the Suomi NPP satellite. Future deliveries of VIIRS will fly onboard JPSS to continue the operational space based climate and weather sensing legacy of the MODIS sensors. Raytheon's Universal Control System (UCS) is an unmanned aerial system (UAS) ""cockpit"" that improves operator awareness and efficiency, while providing the ability to control multiple unmanned aircraft, and reduce potential accidents. The company also makes several software radio and digital communication systems for military applications such as Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC), is participating in Navy-Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI), ECHELON and the Joint Tactical Terminal (JTT) programs. Radioactive materials detection system As part of the company's growing homeland security business and strategic focus, Raytheon has teamed with other contractors to develop an Advance Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) to allow border officials to view and identify radioactive materials in vehicles and shipping containers more effectively. Raytheon also manufactures semiconductors for the electronics industry. In the late 20th century it produced a wide range of integrated circuits and other components, but as of 2003 its semiconductor business specializes in gallium arsenide (GaAs) components for radio communications as well as infrared detectors. It is also making efforts to develop gallium nitride (GaN) components for next-generation radars and radios. Missile defense systems In the framework of Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, Raytheon is developing a Ground Based Interceptor (GBI) that includes a booster missile and a kinetic Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV), along with several key radar components, such as the Sea-Based X-Band Radar (SBX) and the Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR). Missiles In a jointly managed project with Hughes Aircraft Co., Raytheon developed the Air Warfare Simulation (AWSIM2), currently used by the USAF for battle staff training at simulation centers worldwide. Raytheon also produces and runs the ABACUS (Advanced BAttlespace CompUter Simulation) or Higher Formation Trainer (HFT) for training HQs from small specialist units up to corps level. Training Services and Learning Outsourcing Raytheon Professional Services (RPS) is a global leader Clients are offered training tailored to their needs. The scope of each contract can vary from short-term training initiatives and projects to multi-year outsourcing engagements for some or all of a client’s training function. Services include: (1) Performance Consulting &amp; Learning Strategy Development, (2) Training Design, Development &amp; Delivery, (3) Learning Technologies and (4)Training Administration Controversies for managing NSF South Pole Station). This, along with heavy lobbying, has led to perennial charges of influence peddling. Raytheon, for instance, contributed nearly a million dollars to various defense-related political campaigns in the presidential election year of 2004, spending much more than that on lobbying expenses. During the 1991 Gulf War, Raytheon received widespread publicity in the United States in connection with its manufacture of the Patriot missile (MIM-104 Patriot). The Patriot missile is an anti-aircraft missile that was upgraded to have some capability against ballistic missiles. The Patriot had allegedly intercepted Scud missiles launched by Iraq in its defense against the U.S.-led invasion. When President George H. W. Bush traveled to Raytheon's Patriot manufacturing plant in Andover, Massachusetts, during the Gulf War, he declared, the """"Patriot is 41 for 42: 42 Scuds engaged, 41 intercepted!"" The PAVE PAWS (Precision Acquisition Vehicle Entry Phased Array Warning System) system was designed to detect incoming submarine-launched ballistic missiles. The government claimed in a federal lawsuit that Raytheon inflated a contract to upgrade two of four PAVE PAWS sites by proposing to hire higher-skilled employees than were necessary for the job. In 2010 Raytheon developed an ""extreme-scale analytics"" system named Rapid Information Overlay Technology (RIOT), which allows the user to track people's movements and even predict their behaviour by mining data from social networking sites including Facebook, Twitter, Gowalla, and Foursquare. Raytheon claims that it has not sold this software to any clients, but has shared it with US government and industry. Raytheon was given until the end of the month to independently test whether or not the groundwater that originated from its area was contaminated. According to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the groundwater contained carcinogenic contaminants, including trichloroethylene, 1,4-dioxane, and vinyl chloride. In another case, Raytheon was ordered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to treat groundwater at the Tucson Plant (acquired during the merger with Hughes) in Arizona since Raytheon used and disposed metals, chlorinated solvents, and other substances at the plant since 1951.

Student Veterans of America: Raytheon and Student Veterans of America first joined forces in 2012 with the shared mission of empowering veterans by helping them achieve their higher education goals. The Raytheon-SVA Scholarship is designed to help veterans earn secondary and advanced degrees in STEM subjects. Raytheon’s support also provides funding for veterans’ leadership training, mentoring and career guidance, as well as research initiatives. Philanthropy On October 26, 2006, Raytheon was recognized by U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao as a recipient of the 2006 New Freedom Initiative (NFI) Award for the company’s commitment to recruit, train, hire and promote individuals with disabilities. In 2007, leadership at Raytheon organized the Creating Pathways to Work retreat, a daylong strategic-visioning event bringing together key representatives of federal and state government, educators, members of the business community and advocates for people with disabilities, along with Rhode Island Congressman Jim Langevin, the first quadriplegic elected to Congress. They sought to address the barriers and challenges people with disabilities face when trying to enter the workforce."

A member of the S&amp;P 500 Index, the company provides retail and commercial banking, trust, securities brokerage, mortgage and insurance products and services. Regions is the only member of the Fortune 500 headquartered in Alabama (ranked #479 in 2015), Regions Financial Corporation started on July 13, 1971 with the merger of three Alabama banks: First National Bank of Montgomery (opened 1871), Exchange Security Bank of Birmingham (opened 1928), and First National Bank of Huntsville (opened 1856). The combined company was known as First Alabama Bancshares, the first state-chartered bank holding company in Alabama. It served as a hospital for Union soldiers during the American Civil War, and once held a rifle owned by Frank James as collateral for bail money when he was incarcerated across the street in the Madison County Jail. In 1986, changes in the Interstate Banking Bill allowed bank holding companies to purchase bank branches outside the state in which they were chartered. First Alabama Bancshares expanded its operations first into Florida, continuing into Georgia, Tennessee, and Arkansas. To reflect its growth into a regional company, First Alabama Bancshares changed its name to Regions Financial Corporation and the name of its banking subsidiary to Regions Bank on May 2, 1992. Regions added banking branches in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, South Carolina, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. The name ""Regions"" was purchased from First Commercial Corporation, the Arkansas Bank that Regions subsequently purchased in 1998. The Louisiana Regions Banks were established in Monroe (Ouachita Parish) by two former members of the Louisiana State Senate, Jamar Adcock and William R. ""Billy"" Boles, Sr.. On April 10, 2002, Regions Financial Corporation announced that it has begun the process of listing its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol ""RF"". . In addition to the bank subsidiary, Regions Financial operated a mortgage bank – Regions Mortgage – a trust company, and an investment subsidiary – Regions Investment Company, Inc. (RICI). Later, Rebsamen Insurance Company was acquired, further expanding the range of financial services offered by the company. Currently, Regions is the largest deposit holder in Alabama, with $22.8 billion in local deposits, or 25.7% of all local deposits. In Tennessee, Regions is also the largest deposit holder with $17.3 billion in total deposits, or 14.1% of all local deposits. Regions has $4 billion in deposits (7.5% of local deposits) in Arkansas, $7.2 billion in deposits (7.6% of local deposits) in Louisiana, $6.6 billion in deposits (13.8% of local deposits) in Mississippi, and $19.1 billion in deposits (4.2% of local deposits) in Florida. Regions moved into its current headquarters building, the Regions Center, after its merger with Amsouth from the former Regions Plaza (now Viva Health building) diagonally across North 20th Street in downtown Birmingham. Regions share's the Birmingham $33 billion banking scene with 47 other banks including Wells Fargo, BBVA Compass, Synovus (locally operated as First Commercial Bank), ServisFirst, BB&amp;T, Cadence Bank, PNC Bank, AloStar Bank, and IberiaBank. Regions currently held more than 35% of all local deposits in 2014. Upon completion of the merger, which took place on November 4, 2006, Regions Financial became the nation's eighth largest bank with total assets of nearly $140 billion and approximately 2,000 branches and more than 2,400 ATMs throughout a 16-state network. Jackson W. Moore remained chairman of the combined company while C. Dowd Ritter (chairman, president, and CEO of AmSouth) assumed roles as president and CEO of Regions Financial until April 1, 2010. Grayson Hall has now assumed president and CEO responsibilities. AmSouth branches in Alabama and Florida closed or converted to Regions on July 13, 2007. AmSouth branches in Event 2 either closed or converted to Regions on October 26, 2007. Some AmSouth branches remained in northwest Georgia, but they were converted on the evening of December 6, 2007 and the AmSouth name is now retired. Upon the merger, Regions adopted its new corporate logo and ""life green"" color scheme. Integrity Bank On August 29, 2008, Integrity Bank, of Alpharetta, Georgia, was placed into receivership by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Regions Bank assumed its operations."

It has been hailed on Wall Street for its increase in share price, and attracted celebrity investors Warren Buffett and Bill Gates. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and states' Department of Environmental Protection have levied several high-profile fines against it; In 2013 the Missouri Attorney General filed a lawsuit about an uncontrolled underground fire at the Bridgeton Sanitary Landfill, polluting air and water and threatening adjacent West Lake Landfill which contains nuclear waste, scheduled to go to trial. Contents 1 Company history 2 Market share 3 Operations 4 Environmental track record 5 Lobbying 6 References 7 External links Company history The Wall Street Journal reported in June 2010 that Republic Services’ $4 billion acquisition of Allied in December 2008 ""has been successful from the start"", delivering at the high end of the annual savings projected when they did the deal ($191 million), a 27% increase in share price. In mid-2009, Warren Buffett accumulated about 10 million shares equaling a roughly 3% stake, while Bill Gates remained one of the largest investors, with a roughly 15% stake. In December 2008, Republic Services, Inc. relocated its corporate office from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Phoenix, Arizona (Allied's headquarters) and controlled the following combined operations, compared with their larger competitor Waste Management, Inc: Republic Services owned and operated the largest landfill in the United States at 2,200 acres (890&#160;ha) located in Apex, Nevada. On May 6, 2010 Allied Waste, a Republic Services company, upgraded its Pacific Region Compost Facility (PRC) with the state’s first food composting facility, accept all food waste including meat, bread and vegetable products, which per the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is almost 15 percent of the material landfilled in Oregon. Allied Waste paved 2 acres (8,100&#160;m2) purchased and installed a composting system that has been used successfully in Washington and California called “aerated static pile technology”. It captures and controls emissions from the composting process using a negative air system has a smaller footprint than other methods, and reduces the amount of storm water runoff. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and states' Department of Environmental Protection have levied several high-profile fines against Republic Services. In 2002, Allied Waste was ordered to pay a fine of $782,550 by the EPA and spend $2.3 million on an environmental project to improve air quality for violations of the Clean Air Act in Roxbury, Massachusetts. In January 2010, the EPA's Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) selected three Republic Services landfill gas-to-energy projects (LFGTE) as LFGTE Projects of the Year for 2009. Ox Mountain Landfill in Half Moon Bay, California; Jefferson City Landfill in Jefferson City, Missouri and Oak Grove Landfill in Winder, Georgia were honored at the annual LMOP conference in Baltimore in January 2010. ^ a b c d e f g h i ""2014 Summary Annual Report (10-K)"".&#160; ^ a b ""Notice of the 2015 Annual Meetings of Shareholders and 2015 Proxy Statement"".&#160; ^ Stewart Bailey.

The company has acquired several companies, including Hughes-Avicom's in-flight entertainment business, Sony's in-flight entertainment business (Sony Trans Com), Intertrade Ltd., Flight Dynamics, K Systems, Inc. (Kaiser companies), Communication Solutions, Inc., Airshow, Inc., NLX (Simulation Business) in 2003, portions of Evans &amp; Sutherland, TELDIX GmbH, IP Unwired, Anzus Inc., Datapath Inc. (divested in 2014), SEOS Displays Ltd., Air Routing International in 2010, Computing Technologies for Aviation (CTA) in 2011, In the mid-1930s, the Collins Radio Company constructed and sold transmitters and audio mixing consoles to the broadcast industry. The model 12H, which appears to be the first manufactured broadcast console to integrate the amplifiers into the control surface case, was called a ""speech input assembly"". Due to the Great Depression, fewer than 100 were sold and only a handful remain today. Extant 12Hs show revision numbers as high as 12H-10, and some of the tube types were changed over the course of the revisions. One variant is known called the 12N, almost identical in appearance. In 1939, as war in Europe broke out, the model 12 Speech Input Console as well as the 26C limiter amplifier was licensed to Canadian Marconi Co. as the C12H and C26C respectively for both sales in Canada (for the new Canadian Radio Network) and Her Majesties Service for the war effort. Collins success in constructing broadcast transmitters continued to grow, selling well over a thousand up to the start of World War II. During World War II Collins expertise grew in higher power transmitters producing designs which ran well over 15 kilowatts of RF power on a continuous basis. After the war a limited number of AM transmitters were produced called the 300G and remain the finest in low power AM transmitters (300W) ever produced. The 300G employed the lowest noise circuitry of the time using the 6A5G triode that was more than 10db quieter than its substitutes the 6B4G or 6AV5. Collins remained an important manufacturer of AM and FM broadcast radio transmitters for the commercial market surviving the drastic cost cutting market of the 1960s and 1970s. The transmitter line was later sold to Continental Electronics, which continued to produce a number of Collins designs under its own nameplate before phasing them out in the 1980s. Many Collins transmitters remain in service, primarily as backups for more modern equipment. As history would have it, Continental destroyed all the imported Collins documentation in a random and unexpected warehouse clean-up. Very few original documents remain today and what survived is essentially in the hands of collectors. Some documentation was recently donated to the University of Iowa Library. Around 1947, the company introduced their first amateur radio receiver, the 75A-1 (originally simply called the 75A). This set achieved excellent stability for the time due to high build quality and the use of a permeability tuned oscillator (PTO) in its second conversion stage. It was one of the few double conversion superheterodynes on the market and covered only the amateur bands. With the experience gained in the design of the 75A-1, Collins released the 51J-1 receiver, a general coverage HF set covering .5 to 30&#160;MHz. It would be produced in somewhat updated versions (51J-2, 51J-3, 51J-4) for about a decade. It found use in military and commercial settings but was too expensive for most enthusiasts. In the military it was known as the R-388 and was used in multiple receiver diversity RTTY installations. The 75A amateur line was updated throughout the early 50s, finishing with the 75A-4, which was released in 1955. The Collins mechanical filter was introduced to consumers in the 75A-3, and the 75A-4 was one of the first receivers marketed specifically as a single sideband receiver. Collins R-390A radio receiver Around 1950, Collins began designing the R-390 (.5–30&#160;MHz) for the US military. This was intended to be a receiver of the highest performance available, with the ruggedness and serviceability required for military duty. It featured direct mechanical digital frequency readout. The set is composed of several modules for easy field repair—a bad module could simply be swapped out and repaired later, or junked. Sets built during the original 1951 contract cost the government about $2500 each and around 16,000 were produced. Concurrently, Collins developed the R-389, a longwave version with fewer than 1000 made. The R-391, another variant of the R-390, allowed choice of 8 different autotuned channels. The three radios shared common power supplies, audio and intermediate frequency modules. About three years later, Collins delivered the R-390A to the military. While nominally a cost-reduced R-390 (savings of about $250 each), its design compromises were minimal, and it added mechanical filters for improved selectivity. The gear-driven tuning and band change mechanisms were simplified and the parts count reduced. About 54,000 were produced and the set was a military workhorse until the 1970s. Like the R-390, it can outperform many modern radios, to the point that it was designated top secret until the late 1960s. In 1958 Collins replaced the 75A series with the much smaller 75S series, part of the S/Line, discussed in the next section. These featured mechanical filters, very accurate frequency readout, and excellent stability. At the request of the US government, Collins designed the 51S-1 general coverage set, which was essentially (in intended use) a physically smaller replacement for the 51J series. It was not intended as a replacement for the higher performance R-390A, and unlike the R-390A, it was extensively marketed for commercial use. Collins produced a few high performance solid state receivers in the 1970s, such as the 651S-1. Like their tube predecessors, these are coveted by collectors today. Transceivers and systems With the introduction of the S/Line in 1958, Collins moved from designing individual products that could be used together, to ones that were designed to integrate and operate together, in various combinations, as a system. They were the first equipment maker to take this approach. Collins was also the first to introduce a compact HF transceiver, the KWM-1, the year before. Together, these two innovations put Collins temporarily ahead of its competition and set the stage for other manufacturers and the next generation of amateur (and military) HF radio equipment. The 75S-1 receiver and 32S-1 transmitter, comprising the heart of the S/Line, operated separately or together to transceive. The units included crystal bandpass filters and a new compact PTO design that provided stable, highly linear tuning across 200&#160;kHz band segments. The S/Line tuning dial mechanism was unique when introduced. It used concentric dials and a gear mechanism that provided precise dial resolution, better than 1&#160;kHz. Collins S/Line – 516F-2 power supply, 75S-3B receiver, 32S-3 transmitter, 312B-4 console, SM-1 microphone, circa 1969 Within a few years Collins had introduced additional S/Line components, including the 30S-1 kilowatt power amplifier, the 30L-1 desktop power amplifier, and the 62S-1 transverter, which provided coverage of the 6 meter (50&#160;MHz) and 2 meter (144&#160;MHz) amateur bands. The KWM-2 transceiver replaced the KWM-1 using many of the S/Line’s design features and matching its styling. Other accessories included speakers, microphones and control consoles. Illustrating the uniqueness of their new, smaller units in the market, Collins advertisements in the 1950s and early 1960s emphasized the S/Line’s physical styling and size as often as they did its performance. Collins continued to improve the S/Line, first introducing the S-2, then the S-3 units, the 75S-3 (and -3A, -3B and -3C) receiver, and the 32S-3 and -3A transmitters. The -3A and -3C units were identical to the -3 and -3B units, respectively, except they provided an extra set of heterodyne oscillator crystals enabling them to cover extra bands – useful for military, amateur and MARS operation, where operation just outside the regular amateur bands was necessary. Collins 30L-1 Amplifier ca. 1970 Among amateur radio operators, the S/Line established its reputation as perhaps the most solidly engineered equipment available – and the most costly. As a result, S/Line equipment, and the A-Line and other predecessors, are restored, prized, and operated on the air by collectors today. Collins continued to produce the S/Line well into the late 1970s and after its acquisition by Rockwell. In 1978, with the move to solid state design, the S/Line came to an end after a two decade production run. The KWM-380 transceiver was introduced the next year – a break with the past both in its use of transistors and digital technology, and its styling. It would be Collins’ final entry in the amateur radio market until it was discontinued in the mid-1980s. Rockwell Collins has four main divisions: Commercial Systems (CS) Government Systems (GS) International and Service Solutions (I&amp;SS) Information Management Solutions (IMS) The CS division services the commercial airline industry and business aircraft, providing navigation, communication, Synthetic vision, other cockpit products such as autoland autopilots, and cabin products such as In Flight Entertainment (IFE). The GS division services primarily the US government and military, but also provides some products and services to foreign governments with close ties to the United States. Notable government related projects that Rockwell Collins has involvement with are Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS), Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT), Defense Advanced GPS Receiver (DAGR), and Future Combat Systems. The I&amp;SS division is an amalgamation of (IB) International Business organization whose responsibility is sales, engineering and human resource of personnel outside of North America and Service Solutions who provides support services such as customer support,simulation and training and technical publications. I&amp;SS provide a common service to both CS and GS divisions and its formation was announced on the Rockwell Collins press release web page on February 19, 2010. As with several other brands of vintage radio equipment, there is an active community of Collins radio enthusiasts, with clubs, web sites and on-line discussions dedicated to restoring and operating the equipment. The Collins Collectors Association (CCA) and the Collins Radio Association (CRA) are two examples of such organizations. Groups of Collins users also organize meetings, gatherings at hamfests and regularly scheduled on-air discussions called “nets”."

Ryder divides its business into three segments: Fleet Management Solutions, Supply Chain Solutions, and Dedicated Contract Carriage. In 2008 (the last year whose report is posted online) the total company revenue was $6.2 billion with EBIT (earnings before income taxes) of $459 million. The numbers mentioned below are before eliminations. Ryder' supply chain operations accounted for 26% of its revenue for a total of $1.6 billion. Profit of $42 million was 9% of the total. This business consists of management of a customer's supply chain. Basically the customer owns the trucks and Ryder decides where they go, managing the warehouses and the drivers. Ryder managed over 15,000,000 square feet (1,393,546&#160;m2) of warehouse space on December 31, 2008. The white Ryder trucks seen on highways today are available to the general public looking to move locally (returning the truck to the original pick-up location), businesses, and companies that have a contractual agreement with Ryder.

SanDisk’s sole focus on flash memory has led the company to achieve notable “firsts,” from launching the world’s first solid state drive in 1991 to introducing the industry’s Multi-Level Cell (MLC) flash technologies using two bits (X2) and three bits (X3) per cell.the first small memory card and the first memory card that used in capacitive touchscreen mobile phone(LG KE850) the microSD and 1Z-nanometer (nm) technology, the world’s smallest and most advanced NAND flash process node. Three-bits-per-cell technology X3 NAND uses three bits per cell technology to provide 20 percent more memory chips-per-wafer3 for greater manufacturing efficiency and lower chip cost for the same capital investment. When combined with SanDisk’s All Bit Line (ABL) architecture with advanced programming algorithms and multi-level storage management schemes, X3 NAND flash memory chips offer performance and reliability similar to MLC on the same technology but at a significantly lower cost. SanDisk’s 3D NAND technology development remains on track to begin pilot production in the second half of 2015 with volume production targeted in 2016. Gleaning from an IP report on 3D memory which a technology consulting firm LexInnova has released in May 2015, SanDisk is one of the top three patent assignees (with Samsung and Micron) of 3D technology domain with 829 patent applications. The number of patents/patent applications owned by these top assignees comprise around 54 percent of the total patents/patent applications (around 2,300) filed in this domain. SanDisk founders: Jack Yuan, Eli Harari, and Sanjay Mehrotra (2010). SanDisk was founded in 1988 by Dr. Eli Harari, Sanjay Mehrotra and Jack Yuan, non-volatile memory technology experts. SanDisk co-founder Dr. Eli Harari developed the Floating Gate EEPROM which proved the practicality, reliability and endurance of semiconductor-based data storage. This pioneering work laid the foundation for the flash memory market that significantly impacted the consumer electronics industry, enabling new products across multiple categories. Early on, SanDisk (then known as SunDisk) recognized that digital cameras would need removable flash memory storage, and computers could become ever more mobile and light and would require a similar storage technology. ^ a b c d e f ""SanDisk Annual Report"".

However, its corporate structure dates to 1924, with the formation of Broad River Power Company. A year later, Broad River bought the electric and gas properties of Columbia Railway, Gas and Electric Company. In 1927, the Lexington Water Power Company received a license to build a dam on the Saluda River northwest of Columbia. Saluda Dam, which would create the 50,000-acre (202&#160;km2) Lake Murray, was the largest man-made barrier built for power production in the world when completed in 1930. In addition, the project provided jobs during the Great Depression. In 1937, the Broad River Power Company changed its name to South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas Company. Five years later, Lexington Water Power Company merged with SCE&amp;G. This was followed in 1948 with the acquisition of South Carolina Power Company, successor to Charleston Gas Light, from the Southern Company. In 1984, SCE&amp;G formed SCANA as a holding company. Today, SCE&amp;G is a regulated public utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 661,000 retail and wholesale customers in a service area covering more than 17,000 square miles (44,000&#160;km2) in the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina. The company is also engaged in the purchase and sale of natural gas, primarily at retail, to approximately 314,000 customers in a service area covering more than 22,000 square miles (57,000&#160;km2)--most of the state outside of the Upstate and the South Carolina portion of the Charlotte area. SCE&amp;G currently operates 4 hydroelectric plants, 1 pumped-storage hydroelectric plant, 4 coal-fired plants, 1 nuclear plant, 1 combined cycle power plant, 1 ""re-powered"" formerly coal-fired plant with a natural gas-powered steam unit and two combined cycle units, and 16 simple cycle combustion turbines.

This Houston building, as of 2015, houses the Schlumberger U.S. executive offices Schlumberger complex in Sugar Land, Texas Schlumberger was founded in 1926 by German/French brothers Conrad and Marcel Schlumberger from the Alsace region during the German occupation as the Société de prospection électrique (French: Electric Prospecting Company). The company recorded the first-ever electrical resistivity well log in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, France in 1927. Today Schlumberger supplies the petroleum industry with services such as seismic acquisition and processing, formation evaluation, well testing and directional drilling, well cementing and stimulation, artificial lift, well completions, flow assurance and consulting, and software and information management. The company is also involved in the groundwater extraction Over the years, Schlumberger continued to expand its operations and acquisitions. In 1960, Dowell Schlumberger (50% Schlumberger, 50% Dow Chemical), which specialized in pumping services for the oil industry, was formed. In 1962, Schlumberger Limited became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Schlumberger purchased 50% of Forex in 1964 and merged it with 50% of Languedocienne to create the Neptune Drilling Company. The first computerized reservoir analysis, SARABAND, was introduced in 1970. The remaining 50% of Forex was acquired the following year; Neptune was renamed Forex Neptune Drilling Company. In 1979, Fairchild Camera and Instrument (including Fairchild Semiconductor) became a subsidiary of Schlumberger Limited. Schlumberger established the first international data links with e-mail in 1981. In 1983, Schlumberger opened their Cambridge Research Center in Cambridge, England and in 2012 it was renamed the Schlumberger Gould Research Center after the company's former CEO Andrew Gould. In 1987, Schlumberger completed their purchases of Neptune (North America), Bosco and Cori (Italy), and Allmess (Germany). That same year, National Semiconductor acquired Fairchild Semiconductor from Schlumberger for $122 million. In 1999, Schlumberger and Smith International created a joint venture, M-I L.L.C., the world's largest drilling fluids (or mud) company. The company consists of 60% Smith International, and 40% Schlumberger. Since the joint venture was prohibited by a 1994 antitrust consent decree barring Smith from selling or combining their fluids business with certain other companies, including Schlumberger, the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. found Smith International Inc. and Schlumberger Ltd. guilty of criminal contempt and fined each company $750,000 and placed each company on five years probation. Both companies also agreed to pay a total of $13.1 million, representing a full disgorgement of all of the joint venture's profits during the time the companies were in contempt. In 2014, Schlumberger announced the purchase of the remaining shares of SES Holdings Limited (“Saxon”), a Calgary-based provider of international land drilling services, from First Reserve and certain members of Saxon management. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals. Schulmberger had a minority share in Saxon previously. Schlumberger maintains a 33-acre (13&#160;ha) campus at the northeast corner of U.S. Highway 90A and Gillingham Lane in Sugar Land, Texas; as of 2015 Schlumberger is the second largest employer in the city. In 2015 Schlumberger announced that it was moving its U.S. corporate headquarters to the Sugar Land facility from its Houston office building. The company plans to build new buildings with a scheduled completion time of late 2017. They include a total of 250,000 square feet (23,000&#160;m2) of Class A office space and an ""amenities"" building with 100,000 square feet (9,300&#160;m2) of space. In 2006, as the current owner of a facility in Pickens, South Carolina, Schlumberger agreed to pay $11.8&#160;million to federal and state agencies for a problem caused by the previous owner, Sangamo-Weston, a capacitor manufacturing plant. The cause of the problem was from polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) released into the environment by Sangamo-Weston from 1955 to 1987. According to the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division, an additional agreement by Schlumberger to purchase and remove dams will directly improve the Twelvemile Creek, South Carolina ecosystem and provide significant environmental benefits for the affected communities."

Contents 1 Company history 2 Scripps Networks International 3 References 4 External links Company history In 1999 Scripps launched DIY Network, described as the ""go-to destination for rip-up, knock-out home improvement television."" With three brands now under the Scripps Networks umbrella, a $12 million addition was made to the company’s headquarters in Knoxville to provide the infrastructure and technology to support the networks’ growth. Both HGTV (in November 2002) and Food Network (in September 2003) reached full distribution with 80 million subscribers apiece, while Food Network followed HGTV’s footprint into Canada by launching Food Network Canada at the end of 2002. The first half of the decade also saw Scripps Networks add its fourth and fifth networks to its mix, Fine Living Network (2002) and Great American Country (2004). A few months after the acquisition of Great American Country, Scripps Networks announced the move of the network’s headquarters from Denver, Colorado to Nashville, Tennessee. In 2008, Scripps Networks Interactive split from the E.W. Scripps Company and received its own listing on the NYSE as ticker symbol SNI. The year also saw Great American Country reach 50 million subscribers, with DIY Network reaching the 50 million subscriber mark in 2009. Scripps Networks acquired a majority interest in the Travel Channel from Cox Communications for a reported $975 million  in late 2009, and the following year rebranded Fine Living Network as Cooking Channel.

It was incorporated in 1978 as Shugart Technology. Since 2010, the company is incorporated in Dublin, Ireland, with operational headquarters in Cupertino, California, United States. Seagate developed the first 5.25-inch hard disk drive (HDD), the 5-megabyte ST-506, in 1980. They were a major supplier in the microcomputer market during the 1980s, especially after the introduction of the IBM XT in 1983. Today Seagate along with Western Digital dominates the HDD market. Much of their growth has come through acquisition of competitors. In 1989, Seagate acquired Control Data Corporation's Imprimis division, makers of CDC's HDD products. Seagate acquired Conner Peripherals in 1996, Maxtor in 2006, and Samsung's HDD business in 2011.

The name was changed to Seagate Technology to avoid a lawsuit from Xerox's subsidiary Shugart Associates (also founded by Shugart). Seagate ST-225, cover removed. The company's first product, the 5-megabyte ST-506, was released in 1980. It was the first hard disk to fit the 5.25-inch form factor of the Shugart ""mini-floppy"" drive. The hard disk, which used a Modified Frequency Modulation (MFM) encoding, was a hit, and the 30-megabyte version, the ST-238 (physically similar but using a Run Length Limited ((2,7) RLL) encoding to improve storage capacity), were popular aftermarket additions for the IBM XT and AT and compatible microcomputers. In 1989, Seagate acquired Control Data's (CDC) Imprimis Technology, CDC's disk storage division, resulting in a combined market share of 43 percent.

In 2000, the company was taken private by an investment group composed of Seagate management, Silver Lake Partners, Texas Pacific Group and others in a three-way merger-spinoff with Veritas Software; Veritas merged with Seagate, which was bought by the investment group. Veritas was then immediately spun off to shareholders, gaining rights to Seagate Software Network and Storage Management Group (with products such as Backup Exec), as well as Seagate's shares in SanDisk and Dragon Systems. Seagate Software Information Management Group was renamed Crystal Decisions in May 2001. Seagate re-entered the public market in December 2002 on the NASDAQ as ""STX."""

Southern Company is one of the largest producers of electricity in the United States and 149th on the Fortune 500 listing of the largest U. S. corporations. It has more than 500,000 shareholders (NYSE: SO) and has been traded since September 30, 1949. As of 2014, Southern Company is building the first new nuclear units in the U.S. in 30 years at Plant Vogtle near Augusta, Georgia; building one of the largest photovoltaic plants in the U.S. at Cimarron, New Mexico; building one of the largest biomass plants at Nacogdoches, Texas; and installing over four million smart meters by 2012. Four retail electric companies: Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power, serve 120,000 square miles (310,000&#160;km2) in four states. Southern Power serves wholesale customers in the Southeast. Southern Company owns the following companies: Alabama Power - operating company, based in Birmingham. Serves the southern two-thirds of Alabama. Georgia Power - flagship operating company, based in Atlanta. Serves all of Georgia, except four mostly rural counties. Gulf Power - operating company, based in Pensacola, Florida. Serves most of the Florida Panhandle. Mississippi Power - operating company, based in Gulfport. Serves the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Southern Company Services - (originally named Southern Services, Inc.) - Birmingham, Alabama - Common Services SouthernLINC Wireless - Cellular Telephone Provider - Atlanta, Georgia Southern Nuclear - Engineering and Operations for Nuclear Power Plants - Birmingham, Alabama - (Southern Company is the majority owner and operator of the Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle nuclear power plants.) Southern Company Generation - Fossil and Hydro Operations - Birmingham, Alabama Southern Power - Wholesale Generation - Atlanta, Georgia Southern Telecom - Wholesale Fiber Optic Communications and Data Services - Atlanta, Georgia History Southern Company can be traced back to 1924, when Southeastern Power &amp; Light was formed as a holding company for Alabama Traction, Light and Power (formed 1906), the immediate forerunner of Alabama Power. Later that year, it formed Mississippi Power as a subsidiary, with Gulf Power following in 1925. In 1926, it merged with Georgia Power (formed 1902). In 1930, Southeastern Power &amp; Light merged into the Commonwealth &amp; Southern Corporation. The new system included five Northern companies and six Southern companies. However, in the late 1940s Commonwealth &amp; Southern was dissolved to meet the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Four of the Southern companies—Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power—were deemed to be an integrated system and thus were allowed to remain under common ownership. A new holding company, Southern Company was incorporated in Delaware on November 9, 1945, and moved to Georgia in 1950. The year 1949 saw Southern Company’s first full year of operation. In 1954–55, the company was involved in the Dixon-Yates contract with the Atomic Energy Commission, and the associated political controversy. Plant Vogtle in Georgia. Southern Company and its partners are constructing two new units on this site by 2016-2017. Southern Company subsidiaries operate hydroelectric, gas, coal, and nuclear generation sources to generate approximately 200 terawatt-hours of electricity. In 2009, coal represented 57 percent of the company's output, followed by nuclear (23%) and natural gas (16%). Renewable hydroelectric power represented 4 percent of Southern's generation. Coal-based generation dropped significantly in 2009 from an average of 70% between 2005 and 2008. In June 2010, the United States Department of Energy awarded an $8.3 billion loan guarantee to facilitate the construction of two new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle, near Augusta, Georgia. A Southern Company subsidiary, Georgia Power, owns 45.7% of the current 2,430 MW facility, with co-owners Oglethorpe Power (30%) Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (22.7%) and the City of Dalton (1.6%). The plant is operated by Georgia Power. The $14 billion construction project is scheduled to be completed by 2016 and would double the plant's capacity. Additionally, it employs Transport Gasifier (TRIG) technology. TRIG technology is built on the idea of dry-feed, non-slag gasifiers, which operate at lower temperatures than other coal gasifiers. This dry-feed is crushed, heated, and circulated in the gasifier, producing a flammable synthetic gas, syngas. Syngas can generate electricity with fewer emissions. Of course, other byproducts are produced, like ammonia and sulphuric acid. These particular products are sold for commercial use. Additionally, the company has developed TRIG advanced coal gasification technology which turns coal into gas that can be used to generate electricity with less emissions than traditional coal-fired power plants. Southern Company’s Kemper Project in Mississippi will be the only Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant in the U.S. that will capture and store carbon dioxide emissions from commercial operations starting in 2014. Coal-burning (whether direct or via gasification) energy production continues to be an environmental concern, and Southern Company continues to produce large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions as part of its day-to-day operations."

(NYSE:&#160;LUV) is a major U.S. airline, the world's largest low-cost carrier, headquartered in Dallas, Texas. The airline was established in 1967 by Herb Kelleher and adopted its current name (Southwest Airlines) in 1971. Three airlines (Braniff, Trans-Texas and Continental Airlines) started legal action which was not resolved for three years. Air Southwest prevailed in 1970 when the Texas Supreme Court upheld Air Southwest’s right to fly within Texas. with headquarters in Dallas. Southwest began scheduled flights on June 18, 1971, Dallas to Houston (initially IAH) and Dallas to San Antonio with three 737-200s. Southwest just flew to Dallas Love Field (DAL), Houston (IAH, then HOU) and San Antonio (SAT) until 1975 when it added Harlingen. In 1979 Southwest flew to eleven Texas cities and added its first route out of the state, Houston-New Orleans, around the end of the year. In 1980 Southwest expanded north to Tulsa and Oklahoma City and west to Albuquerque; in 1982, north to Kansas City and west to Phoenix, Las Vegas and California. Flights to Denver started in 1983 (and ended in 1986), to Little Rock 1984, to St Louis and Chicago Midway in 1985, to Nashville in 1986 and to Detroit Metro and Birmingham in 1987. Eastward expansion resumed in 1992 with Cleveland and Columbus, then Baltimore in 1993. The Pacific Northwest started in 1994 after the Morris Air takeover; Tampa and Fort Lauderdale started in January 1996. East to Providence in 1997, Manchester in 1998, and Islip and Raleigh-Durham in 1999. Southwest's only route within California was San Francisco-San Diego until the airline started flying in Oakland in 1989; in the next few years its capacity on the West Coast significantly increased. 1980s–2000s A 737–300 (N648SW) pictured in Southwest's original desert gold livery. On November 30, 1984, Southwest took delivery of their first Boeing 737–300. Southwest was the launch customer and as of May 2012 is the largest operator of the aircraft type. At that time the headquarters had 256,000 square feet (23,800&#160;m2) of space and approximately 650 employees. In early 1995 the building received an additional 60,000 square feet (5,600&#160;m2) of space. As of 2006 Southwest Airlines gained a reputation for ""outside the box thinking"" and proactive risk management, including the use of fuel hedging to insulate against fuel price fluctuation. Some analysts have argued against the style of profit-motivated energy trading Southwest did between 1999 and the early 2000s. They suggested that rather than hedging business risk (such as a hedge on weather to a farmer), Southwest was simply speculating on energy prices, without a formal rationale for doing so. At present, Southwest has enjoyed much positive press (and a strong financial boost) from their energy trading skills. In March 1996, after the Dallas City Council unanimously voted to allow for construction, the airline began to build a 300,000 square feet (28,000&#160;m2) addition to the existing corporate headquarters at a cost of $30&#160;million in 1996 dollars. The airline leased two additional tracts of land, a total of 10 acres (4.0&#160;ha) of space, from the City of Dallas to build a new pilot training facility, a headquarters expansion, and additional parking spaces. A $9.8&#160;million new pilot training facility was built on a 5 acres (2.0&#160;ha) plot of land owned by the city of Dallas; it was scheduled to be completed Spring 1997. With the new pilot training facility built, the old one would be removed and the company would expand its headquarters building on the former training facility site. 120,000 square feet (11,000&#160;m2) of building space, which had a price of $16&#160;million including fixtures, was built, making the headquarters have a total of 436,000 square feet (40,500&#160;m2). The airline also leased 4.8 acres (1.9&#160;ha) from the city of Dallas to build additional parking; 700 spaces were added to the existing 1,200. After the expansion, Southwest had a total leasehold of about 24 acres (9.7&#160;ha) of land, including its headquarters, training facilities and parking. By the end of 1997, the expansion of the facilities at Love Field and several terminal improvements were expected to cost Southwest $47&#160;million. Southwest remains the dominant passenger airline at Love Field, maintains its headquarters, hangars, training centers and flight simulators adjacent thereto and reflects its ties to Love Field in its winged heart livery and its stock exchange ticker symbol (LUV). 2008–2009 On March 6, 2008, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspectors submitted documents to the United States Congress, alleging that Southwest allowed 117 of its aircraft to fly carrying passengers despite the fact that the planes were ""not airworthy"" according to air safety investigators. Less than one month after submitting its bid, Southwest learned on August 14 that it had lost the initial bidding to Republic Airways Holdings and elected not to counter or pursue the deal further. Southwest stated that its requirement for pilots' unions at both companies to reach a negotiated (not arbitrated) agreement as a condition of acquisition was a key factor in its abandonment of its bid. An AirTran Airways Boeing 737–700 taxiing at Portland Jetport Southwest Airlines first announced the acquisition on September 27, 2010 and received final approval from the United States Department of Justice on April 27, 2011. On May 2, 2011, Southwest Airlines completed the acquisition of AirTran Airways by purchasing all of the outstanding common stock, corporate identity and operating assets of AirTran Holdings, Inc., the former parent company of AirTran Airways. Southwest Airlines estimates the transaction's value at $3.2&#160;billion and expects onetime costs to integrate the two airlines of $500&#160;million, with cost synergies of approximately $400&#160;million annually. The greatest impact on Southwest was the elimination of a direct low-cost competitor, access to Atlanta, international service and the addition of landing slots at New York-LaGuardia Airport and Washington-Reagan Airport. Southwest obtained a single operating certificate (SOC) from the United States Federal Aviation Administration on March 1, 2012, but the airline was not fully integrated until AirTran had its last flight on December 28, 2014. An entity called Guadeloupe Holdings was formed by Southwest and currently acts as a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Airlines and holding company for AirTran's current operations and assets. Southwest's organized labor groups have ceded contractual ""scope"" provisions pending acceptable negotiated seniority integration agreements. AirTran 737 aircraft are in the process of being converted to Southwest's livery and evolve interior. On February 14, 2013, Southwest began codesharing with AirTran. It took the first step on January 26, 2013 by launching shared itineraries in five markets. Southwest continued to launch shared itineraries with 39 more markets beginning February 25, 2013. In April 2013, shared itineraries were expanded to all Southwest and AirTran cities (domestic and international). The company has employed humor in its advertising. Slogans include ""Love Is Still Our Field,"" ""Just Plane Smart,"" ""The Somebody Else Up There Who Loves You,"" ""You're Now Free To Move About The Country,"" ""THE Low Fare Airline,"" ""Grab your bag, It's On!"" and ""Welcome Aboard."" The airline's current slogan is ""If It Matters To You, It Matters To Us."" A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737–700 with blended winglets (N741SA) pictured on the tarmac at Chicago Midway International Airport wearing the airline's original desert gold livery. In March 1992, shortly after Southwest started using the ""Just Plane Smart"" motto, Stevens Aviation, which had been using ""Plane Smart"" for its motto, advised Southwest that it was infringing on its trademark. Instead of a lawsuit, the CEOs for both companies staged an arm wrestling match. Held at the now-demolished Dallas Sportatorium (the famed wrestling facility) and set for two out of three rounds, the loser of each round was to pay $5,000 to the charity of his choice, with the winner gaining the use of the trademarked phrase. A promotional video was created showing the CEOs ""training"" for the bout (with CEO Herb Kelleher being helped up during a sit up where a cigarette and glass of whiskey (Wild Turkey 101) was waiting) and distributed among the employees and as a video press release along with the video of the match itself. Herb Kelleher lost the match for Southwest, with Stevens Aviation winning the rights to the phrase. Kurt Herwald, CEO of Stevens Aviation, immediately granted the use of ""Just Plane Smart"" to Southwest Airlines. The net result was both companies having use of the trademark, $15,000 going to charity and good publicity for both companies. On September 17, 2012, Southwest broke ground on a new Training and Operational Support (TOPS) building. The Aircraft Maintenance Technicians are represented by the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA). Customer Service Agents and Reservation Agents are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union (IAM). Flight Dispatchers, Flight Attendants, Ramp agents and Operations agents are represented by the Transport Workers Union (TWU). Sponsorships Europe's EasyJet and Ryanair are two of the best known airlines to follow Southwest's business strategy in that continent. Other airlines with a business model based on Southwest's system include Canada's WestJet, Malaysia's AirAsia (the first and biggest LCC in Asia), India's IndiGo, Qantas's Jetstar (although Jetstar now operates three aircraft types), Philippines's Cebu Pacific, Thailand's Nok Air, Mexico's Volaris and Turkey's Pegasus Airlines. Although Southwest has been a major inspiration to many other airlines, including Ryanair, AirAsia and Jetstar, the management strategies, for example, of Ryanair, AirAsia and Jetstar differ significantly from those of Southwest. Southwest has fought against the development of a high-speed rail system in Texas. In 1991, a plan was made to connect the Texas Triangle (Houston – Dallas – Fort Worth - San Antonio) with a privately financed high speed train system which would quickly take passengers from one city to the next. This was the same model Southwest Airlines used 20&#160;years earlier to break into the Texas market where it served the same cities. Southwest Airlines, with the help of lobbyists, created legal barriers to prohibit the consortium from moving forward and the entire project was eventually scuttled in 1994, when the State of Texas withdrew the franchise.

Spirit One was the first plane painted in the canyon blue fleet color scheme. The second livery replaces the former primary color, desert gold, with canyon blue and changes the Southwest text and pinstripes to gold. The orange and red stripes continued to be used. The pinstripe along the plane was drawn in a more curved pattern instead of the straight horizontal line separating the colors in the original. For aircraft equipped with blended winglets, the blended winglets were painted to include the text Southwest.com. Southwest completed repainting its entire fleet with the new Canyon Blue livery in early 2010; however, The Colleen Barrett Classic (N714CB), The Herbert D. Kelleher One (N711HK), &amp; The Metallic Gold One (N792SW), which are Boeing 737–700 aircraft, retain the original desert gold livery. However, these classics do not have the black paint printed on the nose of the plane and do not have the number one heart on it. Heart livery used 2014-present A new livery, named ""Heart"" and developed with firms GSD&amp;M, Lippincott, VML, Razorfish, and Camelot Communications, was unveiled on September 8, 2014.

N713SW, N715SW Silver One 1996 25th Anniversary aircraft. Originally polished bare metal, it was later painted silver for easier maintenance. It was then re-painted with a silver metallic paint. This aircraft also featured silver seats, which were replaced to conform with the rest of the fleet for simplicity. Silver One also featured silver heart shaped drink stirrers. Most recently Silver One was repainted in the fleet standard Canyon Blue theme due to the silver paint looking dingy and the company felt it did not fit the company's cheerful, bright personality. The Silver One nose logo remained but the interior was replaced with the fleet standard blue and tan.

N8301J Notes ^1 The first aircraft to be painted in the ""Shamu"" scheme was N334SW (1988), a 737–300 and it was later followed by N507SW (Shamu II) and N501SW (Shamu III), both 737-500s. Subsequent to the retirement of Southwest's 737-200s, the 737-500s began to stay within a smaller geographic area formerly operated by the 737-200s and as such, Sea World was no longer getting the optimal national exposure from these two aircraft. Two 737–700 aircraft, N713SW and N715SW, were repainted as the new Shamu aircraft and both N501SW and N507SW were repainted in canyon blue colors. In 2013, N334SW was retired, leaving two Shamu aircraft. The artwork on the nose of each aircraft states ""Shamu"" plus the overhead bins on the aircraft display ads for Sea World. Southwest experience Southwest maintains excellent customer satisfaction ratings; according to the Department of Transportation (DOT) Southwest ranks number one (lowest number of complaints) of all U.S. airlines for customer complaints. Southwest Airlines has consistently received the fewest ratio of complaints per passengers boarded of all major U.S. carriers that have been reporting statistics to the DOT since 1987, which is when the DOT began tracking customer satisfaction statistics and publishing its Air Travel Consumer Report. Prior to 2007, Southwest boarded passengers by grouping the passengers into three groups, labeled A, B and C. Passengers would line up at their specified letter and board. In 2007, Southwest modified their boarding procedure by introducing a number. Each passenger receives a letter (A, B or C) and a number 1 through 60. Passengers line up in numerical order within each letter group and choose any open seat on the aircraft as part of Southwest's open seating policy. Southwest Airlines incidents include 2 deaths (1 non-passenger death on the ground, 1 accidental passenger death in the air) and 7 accidents (including 2 aircraft hull losses). The airline was considered among the 10 safest in the world in 2012. 1 death 1248 December 8, 2005 Boeing 737-700 Chicago, Illinois The aircraft skidded off runway after leaving Chicago Midway International Airport in heavy snow conditions. A six-year-old boy died in a car struck by the plane after it skidded into a street. Passengers on board the aircraft and on the ground reported several minor injuries. The aircraft involved, N471WN, became N286WN after repairs. 1 death (on ground); Several injuries 2294 July 13, 2009 Boeing 737-300 Charleston, West Virginia The flight from Nashville International Airport to Baltimore-Washington International Airport was forced to divert to Yeager Airport in Charleston, West Virginia, after a hole formed on the top of the plane's fuselage near the tail, resulting in depressurization of the cabin and deployment of the oxygen masks. The aircraft landed safely. The Boeing 737 traveled 633 metres (2,077&#160;ft) down the runway with its nose scraping, generating a shower of sparks, coming to rest slightly off the runway. Of 150 people on board, 10 were treated for minor injuries at local hospitals."

Headquartered in Framingham, Massachusetts, the company has retail stores serving customers under its original name in Australia, Austria, Brazil, China, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States, while operating subsidiaries in Argentina as Officenet-Staples, in Netherlands as Staples Office Centre, in Canada as Staples Canada (Bureau en Gros in Quebec), and in Italy as Mondoffice. Staples also does business exclusively with enterprises in the United States, Canada and multiple European countries as Staples Advantage. The company responded by making the ""Easy Button"" a real product (available in English ""easy"", French ""simple"", Spanish ""fácil"" and German ""einfach easy""). These buttons were shipped to stores in the US, Canada and Germany starting in the fall of 2005. Sales of the buttons reached 1.5 million by the end of 2006. The button has been referred to as a ""Marketer's Dream,"" effectively turning millions of Staples customers into advertisers, resulting in greatly increased brand recognition. The typical design for more recently built locations. This location is located in Ontario, California. The Staples Snowbot was an advertising character that appeared in the United States, in television and print advertising during the 2000 and 2001 Christmas seasons. The Snowbot was a robot shaped like a snowman who refuses to let go of the inkjet printer he has fallen in love with. After the printer is wrestled from his grasp, the robot utters a monotone ""Weeping. Weeping."" He is consoled by a Staples employee who offers him a surge protector or a computer mouse (depending on the ad) instead. The robot's ""Weeping. Weeping."" catchphrase briefly became a popular meme on the Internet, and the ad itself was parodied in a 2002 Christmas ad for Dell Computers, in which a robot hassles a shopper (including striking him with a candy cane) when he attempts to purchase a PC at an unnamed office supplies retailer. Another ad style is used during its annual back to school campaign, in which the Christmas song ""It's The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" is played while parents joyously shop for school supplies for their children, used for several years beginning in 1994. The Hanover, Maryland fulfillment center is powered by a 1.01 megawatt solar installation covering nearly 175,000 square feet (16,300&#160;m2) of roof space. In April 2007, Staples introduced its new ""Staples Rewards"" program. Benefits include free delivery on online purchases (of $45 or more) and a quarterly 10% Rewards Coupons of purchases at the Copy and Print Center, and purchases of paper, ink, and toner. Previously Staples offered free delivery on any order for Staples Rewards card holders. Currently only Premier or associate members get free shipping on all orders, base Rewards members get free shipping when using a Staples Credit Card and Rewards card. Premier status can be attained when one spends $1,000 or more in a calendar year. As of January 1, 2010, ""Staples Rewards"" now consists of the following: Earn 10% back in Staples Rewards on ink, toner, paper, and Copy and Print Center purchases every month as long as you have earned $10 or more. Also, anyone can recycle up to 10 ink or toner (20 for Premier) cartridges a month and receive $2 per cartridge in a separate Rewards Coupon. Ink Recycling Statements are now emailed. There is no limit to the total amount of Rewards Coupons a customer can earn (one can receive multiple coupons) and has to reach a minimum of $10 in rewards for the 10% portion or it will roll over until either it has been reached or the end of the calendar quarter (whichever comes first). Rewards Statements are now emailed monthly and will expire at the end of the quarter. Staples' stores in the United Kingdom began trialling the previously named ""Staples Business Rewards"" at a selected number of ""Hypergrowth"" stores (such as Milton Keynes, Poole, Sheffield and Southampton stores) during May 2005. To receive their rewards, customers must spend £100 or more each quarter to receive 2% back on standard purchases and 20% back on Copy and Print Centre purchases. A basic ""Staples Reward"" customer can receive up to £50 back in cash vouchers (which have no minimum 'spend-in-store""). If a customer spends £1,000 or more in a calendar year, the customer is upgraded to the prestigious ""Premier Rewards"" of which they receive 5% on standard purchases and 20% back on the Copy and Print Centre, again if the customer spends over £100 during each quarter. The customer can also receive back up to £100 in vouchers. Security breaches On Oct. 20, 2014 KrebsOnSecurity reported a suspected breach at Staples, after hearing multiple banks had identified a pattern of card fraud (suggesting that several Staples office supply locations in the Northeastern United States were dealing with a data breach). At the time, Staples would say only that it was investigating “a potential issue” and had contacted law enforcement. On December 19, 2014 Staples reported that criminals had deployed malware to point-of-sale systems at 115 of their U.S. retail stores. At 113 stores, the malware may have allowed access to this data for purchases made from August 10, 2014 through September 16, 2014. At two stores, the malware may have allowed access to data from purchases made from July 20, 2014 through September 16, 2014. Overall, the company believes that approximately 1.16 million payment cards may have been affected. On July 14, 2015, Numerous news outlets started to report a suspected data breach at retailers served by online photo software from PNI - Staples' recent acquisition. The first reported victim was Walmart Canada, followed by CVS, Rite-Aid, Costco US, Costco Canada and Tesco UK. At time of writing (30th July) the photo websites of all of these retailers remained shutdown with no ETA on restoration. During the period 13th through 28th July Staples Inc share price fell from $15.59 to $13.97, a 10% fall which reflected a reduction in Staples market value of almost $1bn. It is unclear how much of this fall was related to the ongoing data breach. Community, Initiative for a Competitive Inner City, Hispanic Heritage Foundation and through Staples, ReadBoston. In August 2005, Staples introduced the ""Easy Button"", a novelty item for offices which is advertised as a fun way of relieving stress. The button does nothing other than say ""That was easy"" when pressed. The first USD 1&#160;million of profits each year from the Easy Button are donated to the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. It is currently for sale for USD $4.99-$6.99 in all US and Canadian stores (where profits go to Special Olympics in Canada) and on the company's website. Donations also go to the Children's Fund. Staples has reportedly sold more than $7.5&#160;million worth of Easy Buttons. In addition to selling office supplies, business machines, and tech services Staples also offers a copy and print center for photocopies, digital printing, faxing, custom business cards, custom rubber stamps, promotional products, binding, lamination, folding, cutting and engraved products. Most locations have a full service UPS shipping center offering air, ground, international and freight services, (DHL in the United Kingdom stores &amp; FedEx, Purolator in the Canadian stores and select US stores have USPS and UPS as well), which is open during store hours. In Canada, most web submission jobs and larger orders, including business cards, posters and books are produced in central production facility in each region. The production facilities operate 24-hours and orders are shipped to most of the stores within its regions within a day. The regions in Canada are BC/Yukon, Alberta/NWT, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, and Maritime. The Copy &amp; Print Center was also the first Print Center to offer custom business cards printed in store. Known as 'Instant Business Cards' customers are able to have custom business cards in a matter of hours. Staples also operates stand-alone Copy &amp; Print Stores (currently located in Boston and New York City) where Copy &amp; Print is a brand of Staples. EasyTech Some stores also feature Staples EasyTech, an in-store and on-site service for PC repair, PC upgrades, home and office networking setup, and PC tutorials. Starting in November 2005, Staples began a test called ""Heavy Up"" primarily using stores in New York state to experiment with the expansion of the offerings by the Staples Tech Center. A subsequent test known as ""Double Up"" was planned for an unspecified test market and was scheduled to begin the first half of 2006. The tests ran to promote competition with Best Buy's Geek Squad and Circuit City's Fire dog. Beginning in early 2006, Staples also launched the ""Easy Resident Tech"" program, employing one to two resident computer repair technicians to do in-store repair during normal business hours. Beginning January 30, 2007, Staples launched Staples EasyTech. The launch rebranded the ""Easy Mobile Tech"" name with plans to install an 11' x 17' kiosk in every store. The kiosk may vary from store to store depending on its size and volume. Most kiosks take up part of the Customer Service desk. Within the kiosk, Easy Resident Techs offered repair service as well as sold products. These technicians wore gray ""Easy Tech"" polo shirts to distinguish them from regular Staples workers. While there was typically one tech per store, a second tech may have been employed for high-volume stores. Beginning July 2008, Staples launched a new program labeling all technology workers as ""EasyTechs"". Under the new guidelines all technology workers are required to have the skills necessary to perform basic services such as memory installation and PC configuration. In addition, all technology workers wear black polo shirts with green ""EasyTech"" emblems to set them apart from other store workers. The change was due to the company's new focus on services, allowing more customers to be assisted in less time. Most stores will still have a main ""EasyTech"" who performs most of the more complex tasks. Beginning November 2008, 11 concept stores featuring a broader array of small business technology services were launched, which are known by the company as Best Tech stores. EasyTechs and sales workers were now referred to as ""Tech Advisors"" and ""Solutions Advisors"". The concept stores carry many more technology related products such as digital signage, small business servers, NAS (Network Attached Storage), and business networking. Staples also partnered with an on-demand IT service provider, with such services as network monitoring, advanced network configurations, and server setup. These concept stores are mainly based in New Hampshire, with stores in Nashua, Seabrook, West Lebanon, Dover and Concord. Some stores with this new concept also opened in Massachusetts, including the Auburn store. Other existing stores have been renovated to include Best Tech's services, including the Newington, and Natick store."

European and Scandinavian expansion continued in 2009 with Poland (April), Utrecht, Netherlands (August), and Sweden at Arlanda airport outside Stockholm (October). This was the sixth Starbucks to open in Walt Disney World, following locations in the Magic Kingdom (Main Street, U.S.A.), Epcot (Future World), Disney's Hollywood Studios (Hollywood Boulevard), and two in Disney Springs (Marketplace and West Side). In addition to these six, there are locations in Disneyland (Main Street, U.S.A.), Disney California Adventure (Buena Vista Street), Anaheim's Downtown Disney, and Disney Village at Disneyland Paris. The Downtown Disney and Disney Springs locations are Starbucks-operated, while the locations inside of the theme parks are Disney-operated. Starbucks in Dortmund, Germany Free Wi-Fi Internet access varies in different regions. In Germany customers get unlimited free Wi-Fi through BT Openzone, and in Switzerland and Austria customers can get 30 minutes with a voucher card (through T-Mobile). Since 2003, Starbucks in the UK rolled out a paid Wi-Fi based on one-time, hourly or daily payment. Then, in September 2009, it was changed to a 100% free Wi-Fi at most of its outlets. Customers with a Starbucks Card are able to log-on to the Wi-Fi in-store for free with their card details, thereby bringing the benefits of the loyalty program in-line with the United States. Further more, Starbucks announced its support in the Power Matters Alliance (PMA) and its membership in the PMA board, along with Google and AT&amp;T, in an effort to create ""a real-world ecosystem of wireless power"" through a universal wireless charging standard that customers could use to recharge smart phones. In June 2014, Starbucks announced a new partnership with Arizona State University (ASU) that would allow Starbucks employees in their Junior and Senior years of college to complete four years of college at Arizona State University's online program for only around 23K. Starbucks employees admitted into the program will receive a scholarship from the college, College Achievement Plan (CAP), that will cover 44% of their tuition. The remaining balance and all other expenses would be paid by the student or through traditional financial aid. In April 2015, Starbucks and ASU announced an expansion of the College Achievement Program. The program would now allow all eligible part-time and full-time employees working in a U.S. Starbucks to enroll in the program for full-tuition reimbursement. In 2003, Starbucks sent a cease-and-desist letter to ""HaidaBucks Coffee House"" in Masset, British Columbia, Canada. The store was owned by a group of young Haida men, who claimed that the name was a coincidence, due to ""buck"" being a Haida word for ""young man"" (a claim that cannot be substantiated). After facing criticism, Starbucks dropped its demand after HaidaBucks dropped ""coffee house"" from its name. He thought he could bypass infringement and copyright claims through the “Parody Law”, referring to the parody aspect of Fair Use laws (think Weird Al Yankovich and SNL). No lawsuits were filed though because the store was short-lived. The Los Angeles Health Department shut it down after 4 days because Fielder lacked the proper permits. Grounds for your Garden In 1999, Starbucks started ""Grounds for your Garden"" to make their business environmentally friendlier. This gives leftover coffee grounds to anyone requesting it for composting. Although not all stores and regions participate, customers can request and lobby their local store to begin the practice. In 2004, Starbucks began reducing the size of their paper napkins and store garbage bags, and lightening their solid waste production by 816.5&#160;t (1,800,000&#160;lb). In October 2008, The Sun newspaper reported that Starbucks was wasting 23.4 million liters (6.2 million US gal) of water a day by leaving a tap constantly running for rinsing utensils in a 'dipper well' in each of its stores, In June 2009, in response to concerns over its excessive water consumption, Starbucks re-evaluated its use of the dipper well system. In September 2009, company-operated Starbucks stores in Canada and the United States successfully implemented a new water saving solution that meets government health standards. Different types of milk are given a dedicated spoon that remains in the pitcher and the dipper wells were replaced with push button metered faucets for rinsing. This will reportedly save up to 150&#160;US&#160;gal (570&#160;l) of water per day in every store. Since, Starbucks has partnered with Conservation International (CI) to draft plans and audit its Coffee and Farmer Equity program. Additionally, Professor Marie-Christine Renard of Rural Sociology of Chapingo University in Mexico wrote a case study of Starbucks’, Conservation International’s, and Agro-industries United of Mexico (AMSA) joint conservation effort in Chiapas, Mexico in which she concluded that “ Of the approximately 136,000 metric tons (300&#160;million pounds) of coffee Starbucks purchased in 2006, only about 6% was certified as fair trade. According to Starbucks, they purchased 2,180 metric tons (4.8&#160;million pounds) of Certified Fair Trade coffee in fiscal year 2004 and 5,220 metric tons (11.5&#160;million pounds) in 2005. They have become the largest buyer of Certified Fair Trade coffee in North America (10% of the global market). Transfair USA, According to the company, in 2004 it paid on average $1.42 per pound ($2.64&#160;kg) for high-quality coffee beans, 74% above the commodity prices at the time. Ethos, a brand of bottled water acquired by Starbucks in 2003, is sold at locations throughout North America. Ethos bottles feature prominent labeling stating ""helping children get clean water"", referring to the fact that US$0.05 from each US$1.80 bottle sold (US$0.10 per bottle in Canada) is used to fund clean water projects in under-developed areas. Although sales of Ethos water have raised over US$6,200,000 for clean water efforts, the brand is not incorporated as a charity. Critics have argued that the claim on the label misleads consumers into thinking that Ethos is primarily a charitable organization, when it is actually a for-profit brand and the vast majority of the sale price (97.2%) does not support clean-water projects.

(February 2013) A local coffee shop in New York's East Village claiming it had to close because Starbucks is willing to pay higher rent for the space Starbucks has been accused of selling unhealthy products. Starbucks footprint in the United States, showing saturation of metropolitan areas Some of the methods Starbucks has used to expand and maintain their dominant market position, including buying out competitors' leases, intentionally operating at a loss, and clustering several locations in a small geographical area (i.e., saturating the market), have been labeled anti-competitive by critics. Starbucks workers in seven stores have joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) as the Starbucks Workers Union since 2004. Main article: Christmas controversy § 2010s In November 2015, the coffee shop chain Starbucks introduced solid red seasonal cups, unlike previous seasonal iterations that were decorated with winter or Christmas-oriented imagery (such as reindeer and ornaments), but no overtly religious symbols. The cup design was discussed extensively on social media, with some citing the cup as another example of the ""War on Christmas"", calling it ""cup-gate"", and others expressed puzzlement over the outrage generated by a simple cup. The UK subsidiary pays patent fees to the US subsidiary, purchases coffee beans from the Netherlands subsidiary (where corporation tax is lower than in the UK), and uses the Swiss subsidiary for other ""miscellaneous services"". Starbucks' chief financial officer (CFO) appeared before the Public Accounts Committee in November 2012 and admitted that the Dutch government granted a special tax rate to their European headquarters, which the UK business pays royalties to. In October 2013, China Central Television reported about the windfall profit in Chinese Starbucks. The report compared the price of a tall (12 fl. oz., 354 mL) Latte in Beijing, Chicago, London, and Mumbai. It was found that Beijing stores charged the most while Mumbai stores charged the least. It was also found that a tall latte cost 4 Chinese yuan (approx. USD $0.67) to make, but it sold at 27 yuan (approx. USD $4.50), creating a windfall profit for Starbucks in China from the higher margins."

Those hotels, as well as a number of top-tier Sheraton Hotels, were then marketed as ITT Sheraton Luxury Hotels. After Starwood bought Sheraton, they established a separate brand identity for The Luxury Collection and expanded it. Both ITT Sheraton and later Starwood kept CIGA's original logo (the four horses of St. Mark) for The Luxury Collection brand logo until 2010; each Luxury Collection hotel now uses its own logo. Many hotels in The Luxury Collection are smaller establishments in converted palaces or other significant buildings, others are restored historic hotels. Confusingly, some hotels in The Luxury Collection which were originally part of the ITT Sheraton Luxury group kept their Sheraton name when the Luxury division was spun off as a completely separate brand under Starwood. There are four such hotels remaining today, operating with the name Sheraton, but not technically part of Sheraton. These hotels are the Sheraton Addis (Addis Ababa, Ethiopia), Sheraton Grande Sukhumvit (Bangkok, Thailand), Sheraton Algarve Hotel (Albufeira, Portugal), and Sheraton Kuwait Hotel (Kuwait City, Kuwait). A part of the Collection, the Royal Penthouse Suite, at Hotel President Wilson in Geneva, billed at US$65,000 per night, is listed at number 1 on World's 15 Most Expensive Hotel Suites list complied by CNN Go in 2012. St. Regis is Starwood's main luxury brand, launched in 1999. It is named for The St. Regis Hotel in New York, which was built in 1904 in Manhattan at 5th Avenue and 55th Street by John Jacob Astor IV, who also founded the Astoria Hotel (which later became the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel) and who died in 1912 on the RMS Titanic. In the 1930s, head bartender Fernand Petiot, introduced the Bloody Mary cocktail. The St. Regis was a Sheraton from 1966 on, and following a lavish restoration from 1985 to 1991 was part of the ITT Sheraton Luxury division before it became the cornerstone of Starwood's new brand.

Bank Solid. SunTrust. Website SunTrust.com SunTrust locations in the United States. SunTrust Banks, Inc., is an American bank holding company. The largest subsidiary is SunTrust Bank. It had US$175 billion in assets as of December 31, 2013. The current SunTrust Banks, Inc., was the result of a merger between the Trust Company of Georgia and SunBanks, Inc., of Orlando, Florida (founded in 1934 as First National Bank of Orlando) in 1985. The merged company operated as Trust Company Bank in Georgia and Sun Bank in Florida until 1995, when all banks took the SunTrust name. In 1986, shortly after the Trust Company–SunBanks merger, SunTrust purchased Third National Corporation of Nashville, though it continued to use the Third National name in Tennessee until 1995. SunTrust purchased Crestar Financial Corporation of Richmond, Virginia in 1998 expanding the company’s footprint into Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Crestar's (and SunTrust's) earliest predecessor, Farmers Bank of Alexandria, was founded in 1811. In 2001, SunTrust purchased the institutional businesses of the Robinson-Humphrey Company, LLC. creating SunTrust Robinson-Humphrey. The company bought Memphis-based National Commerce Financial Corporation (NCF) for $7 billion in 2004. The bank operated as National Bank of Commerce in South Carolina, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia and West Virginia and as Central Carolina Bank and Trust in North Carolina. This acquisition allowed SunTrust to enter Alabama, the Carolinas and West Virginia for the first time, and substantially increased its footprint in the other states. As a result, the bank received some of Coke's publicly traded stock, and SunTrust retains 48.3 million shares (3.58%) of Coke as of 2006. This stake, which has a GAAP cost of $110,000, is today worth approximately $2 billion and pays $59 million a year in dividends. In addition, the original copy of the formula for Coca-Cola is stored in a safe deposit box of a SunTrust location in Atlanta. Products The bank's primary businesses include deposit, credit, trust and investment services. Through its various subsidiaries, the company provides mortgage banking, asset management, securities brokerage, and capital market services. 2014 National Mortgage Settlement In 2014, the Federal government together with state attorneys general in 49 states and the District of Columbia reached a settlement requiring SunTrust Mortgage, Inc., to provide $500 million in various forms of relief to mortgage borrowers. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia entered the Consent Order on September 30, 2014. The consent order addressed SunTrust's alleged misconduct regarding its mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices. SunTrust was also required to create a 40 million dollar fund for the approximately 45,000 SunTrust borrowers who were foreclosed upon between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2013. In addition, SunTrust was required to adhere to significant new homeowner protections. The consent order required that SunTrust follow the servicing standards set up by the 2012 National Mortgage Settlement (NMS) with the five largest banks. Controversies In September 2015 SunTrust laid off one hundred IT professionals with a controversial severance agreement clause by SunTrust that required laid-off employees to be available to help without pay for a period of two years. On October, 23rd Suntrust reversed course and removed the clause """"to make myself reasonably available to SunTrust regarding matters in which I have been involved in the course of my employment with SunTrust and/or about which I have knowledge as a result of my employment with SunTrust."""" Buildings and branches Located at 200 South Orange Avenue, The SunTrust Center is the tallest building in downtown Orlando, Florida. The 35 story, 650,000&#160;sq&#160;ft (60,000&#160;m2) building was constructed in 1988 at a cost of approximately $100 million.

(August 2013) Symantec Corporation Symantec headquarters in Mountain View, California Type Public Traded&#160;as NASDAQ:&#160;SYMC S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Computer software Founded March&#160;1, 1982; 34 years ago&#160;(1982-03-01) Sunnyvale, California, U.S. Founder Gary Hendrix Headquarters 350 Ellis Street, Mountain View, California, U.S. Area served Worldwide Key people Daniel Schulman (Chairman) Michael Brown (President and CEO) Products The Norton Antivirus suite, Enterprise Vault and other products Revenue US$ 6.508 billion (2015) Operating income US$ 1.149 billion (2015) Profit US$ 878 million (2015) Total assets US$ 13.23 billion (2015) Total equity US$ 5.935 billion (2015) Number of employees 19,424 (2015) Divisions List of divisions Website www.symantec.com Symantec Corporation /sɪˈmænˌtɛk/ (commonly known as Symantec) is an American technology company headquartered in Mountain View, California, United States. The company produces software for security, storage, backup and availability - and offers professional services to support its software. Netcraft asseses Symantec (including subsidiaries) as the most-used certification authority. Symantec is a Fortune 500 company and a member of the S&amp;P 500 stock-market index. On October 9, 2014, Symantec declared it would split into two independent publicly traded companies by the end of 2015. One company would focus on security, the other on information management. On January 29, 2016, the information-management business was spun-off as Veritas Technologies and sold to The Carlyle Group. Founded in 1982 by Gary Hendrix with a National Science Foundation grant, Symantec was originally focused on artificial intelligence-related projects, including a database program. Hendrix hired several Stanford University natural language processing researchers as the company's first employees, among them Barry Greenstein (professional poker player and developer of the word processor component within Q&amp;A). Hendrix also hired Jerry Kaplan (entrepreneur and author) as a consultant to build the in-RAM database for Q&amp;A. In 1984 it became clear that the advanced natural language and database system that Symantec had developed could not be ported from DEC minicomputers to the PC. This left Symantec without a product, but with expertise in natural language database query systems and technology. As a result, later in 1984 Symantec was acquired by another, smaller software startup company, C&amp;E Software, founded by Denis Coleman and Gordon Eubanks and headed by Eubanks. C&amp;E Software was in the process of developing an integrated file management and word processing program. The merged company retained the name Symantec, and Eubanks became its chairman, Vern Raburn, the former CEO of the original Symantec, remained as CEO of the combined company. Soon after the merger, Eubanks and Raburn recruited Rod Turner into Symantec as its executive vice president for marketing, sales, product management and international business. Turner had been in interviews and discussions with C&amp;E Software in early 1984 about becoming the president of C&amp;E. These discussions had ended when the two companies merged. The new Symantec combined the file management and word processing functionality that C&amp;E had planned, and added an advanced Natural Language query system (designed by Gary Hendrix and engineered by Dan Gordon) that set new standards for ease of database query and report generation. The natural language system was named ""The Intelligent Assistant"". Turner chose the name of Q&amp;A for Symantec's flagship product, in large part because the name lent itself to use in a short, easily merchandised logo. Brett Walter designed the user interface of Q&amp;A (Brett Walter, Director of Product Management). Q&amp;A was released in November 1985. During 1986, Vern Raburn and Gordon Eubanks swapped roles, and Eubanks became CEO and president of Symantec, while Raburn became its chairman. Subsequent to this change, Raburn had little involvement with Symantec, and in a few years time, Eubanks added the Chairmanship to his other roles. After a slow start for sales of Q&amp;A in the fall of 1985 and spring of 1986, Turner signed up a new advertising agency called Elliott/Dickens, embarked on an aggressive new advertising campaign, and came up with the ""Six Pack Program"" in which all Symantec employees, regardless of role, went on the road, training and selling dealer sales staff nationwide in the United States. Turner named it Six Pack because employees were to work six days a week, see six dealerships per day, train six sales representatives per store and stay with friends free or at Motel 6. Simultaneously, a promotion was run jointly with SofSell (which was Symantec's exclusive wholesale distributor in the United States for the first year that Q&amp;A was on the market). This promotion was very successful in encouraging dealers to try Q&amp;A. During this time, Symantec was advised by Jim Lally and John Doerr&#160;— both were board members of Symantec at that stage&#160;— (Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers) that if Symantec would cut its expenses and grow revenues enough to achieve cash flow break-even, then KPCB would back the company in raising more venture capital. To accomplish this, the management team worked out a salary reduction schedule where the chairman and the CEO would take zero pay, all vice presidents would take a 50% pay cut, and all other employees' pay was cut by 15%. Two employees were laid off. Eubanks also negotiated a sizable rent reduction on the office space the company had leased in the days of the original Symantec. These expense reductions, combined with strong international sales of Q&amp;A, enabled the company to attain break-even. Because all team members were sharing in the suffering of reduced income, and because of the unifying effects of the Six Pack Program, Symantec's morale during this period was very high&#160;— the more so when one considers that the company had a very uncertain future at this time. The significantly increased traction for Q&amp;A from this re-launch grew Symantec's revenues substantially, along with early success for Q&amp;A in international markets (uniquely a German version was shipped three weeks after the United States version, and it was the first software in the world that supported German Natural Language) following Turner's having placed emphasis on establishing international sales distribution and multiple language versions of Q&amp;A from initial shipment. In 1985, Rod Turner negotiated the publishing agreement with David Whitney for Symantec's second product, which Turner named NoteIt (an annotation utility for Lotus 1-2-3). It was evident to Turner that NoteIt would confuse the dealer channel if it was launched under the Symantec name, because Symantec had built up interest by that stage in Q&amp;A (but not yet shipped it), and because the low price for the utility would not be initially attractive to the dealer channel until demand had been built up. Turner felt that the product should be marketed under a unique brand name. Turner and Gordon E. Eubanks, Jr., then chairman of Symantec Corporation, agreed to form a new division of Symantec, and Eubanks delegated the choice of name to Turner. Turner chose the name Turner Hall Publishing, to be a new division of Symantec devoted to publishing third-party software and hardware. The objective of the division was to diversify revenues and accelerate the growth of Symantec. Turner chose the name Turner Hall Publishing, using his last name and that of Dottie Hall (Director of Marketing Communications) in order to convey the sense of a stable, long established, company. In May 1990 Symantec announced its intent to merge with and acquire Peter Norton Computing, a developer of various utilities for DOS. Turner was appointed as product group manager for the Norton business, and made responsible for the merger, with P&amp;L responsibility. Ted Schlein was made product group manager for the Q&amp;A business. The Peter Norton group merger logistical effort began immediately while the companies sought approval for the merger, and in August 1990, Symantec concluded the purchase—by this time the combination of the companies was already complete. Symantec's consumer antivirus and data management utilities are still marketed under the Norton name. At the time of the merger, Symantec had built upon its Turner Hall Publishing presence in the utility market, by introducing Symantec Antivirus for the Macintosh (SAM), and Symantec Utilities for the Macintosh (SUM). These two products were already market leaders on the Mac, and this success made the Norton merger more strategic. Symantec had already begun development of a DOS-based antivirus program one year before the merger with Norton. The management team had decided to enter the antivirus market in part because it was felt that the antivirus market entailed a great deal of ongoing work to stay ahead of new viruses. The team felt that Microsoft would be unlikely to find this effort attractive, which would lengthen the viability of the market for Symantec. Turner decided to use the Norton name for obvious reasons, on what became the Norton Antivirus, which Turner and the Norton team launched in 1991. At the time of the merger, Norton revenues were approximately 20 to 25% of the combined entity. By 1993, while being led by Turner, Norton product group revenues had grown to be approximately 82% of Symantec's total. At one time Symantec was also known for its development tools, particularly the THINK Pascal, THINK C, Symantec C++, Enterprise Developer and Visual Cafe packages that were popular on the Macintosh and IBM PC compatible platforms. These product lines resulted from acquisitions made by the company in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These businesses and the Living Videotext acquisition were consistently unprofitable for Symantec, and these losses diverted expenditures away from both the Q&amp;A for Windows and the TimeLine for Windows development efforts during the critical period from 1988 through 1992. Symantec exited this business in the late-1990s as competitors such as Metrowerks, Microsoft and Borland gained significant market share. In 1996, Symantec Corporation was alleged of misleading financial statements in violation of GAAP. As of 2015, Symantec's Norton product line includes Norton Security, Norton Small Business, Norton Family, Norton Mobile Security, Norton Online Backup, Norton360, Norton Utilities and Norton Computer Tune Up. In 2012, PCTools iAntiVirus was rebranded as a Norton product under the name iAntivirus, and released to the Mac App Store. Also in 2012, the Norton Partner Portal was relaunched to support sales to consumers throughout the EMEA and LAM regions. The Symantec Security Response organization (formerly Symantec Antivirus Research Center) is an antivirus and computer security research group with over 400 full-time employees. Mergers and acquisitions Veritas On December 16, 2004, Veritas and Symantec announced their plans for a merger. With Veritas valued at $13.5 billion, it was the largest software industry merger to date. Symantec's shareholders voted to approve the merger on June 24, 2005; the deal closed successfully on July 2, 2005. July 5, 2005, was the first day of business for the U.S. offices of the new, combined software company. As a result of this merger, Symantec includes storage- and availability-related products in its portfolio, namely Veritas File System (VxFS), Veritas Volume Manager (VxVM), Veritas Volume Replicator (VVR), Veritas Cluster Server (VCS), NetBackup (NBU), Backup Exec (BE) and Enterprise Vault (EV). Sygate On August 16, 2005, Symantec acquired Sygate, to be part of Norton Personal Firewall. Altiris On January 29, 2007, Symantec announced plans to acquire Altiris, and on April 6, 2007, the acquisition was completed. Altiris specializes in service-oriented management software that allows organizations to manage IT assets. It also provides software for web services, security and systems management products. Established in 1998, Altiris is headquartered in Lindon, Utah. Vontu On November 5, 2007, Symantec announced its acquisition of Vontu, the leader in Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solutions, for $350 million. that it was spinning off its Application Performance Management (APM) business and the i3 product line to Vector Capital. Precise Software Solutions took over development, product management, marketing and sales for the APM business, launching as an independent company on September 17, 2008. MessageLabs On October 9, 2008, Symantec announced its intent to acquire Gloucester-based MessageLabs (spun off from Star Internet in 2007) to boost its Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business. Symantec purchased the online messaging and Web security provider for about $695 million in cash. The acquisition closed on November 17, 2008. PGP and Guardian Edge On April 29, 2010, Symantec announced its intent to acquire PGP and Guardian Edge. The acquisitions closed on June 4, 2010, and provided access to established encryption, key management and technologies to Symantec's customers. Verisign authentication On May 19, 2010, Symantec signed a definitive agreement to acquire Verisign’s authentication business unit, which included the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Certificate, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Verisign Trust and Verisign Identity Protection (VIP) authentication services. The acquisition closed on August 9, 2010. In August 2012, Symantec completed its rebranding of the Verisign SSL Certificate Service by renaming the Verisign Trust Seal the Norton Secured Seal. Rulespace Acquired in October 10, 2010, RuleSpace is a web categorisation product first developed in 1996. The categorisation is, automated using what Symantec refers to as the Automated Categorization System (ACS). It is used as the base for content filtering by many UK ISP. Clearwell Systems On May 19, 2011, Symantec announced the acquisition of Clearwell Systems for approximately $390 million. LiveOffice On January 17, 2012, Symantec announced the acquisition of cloud email-archiving company LiveOffice. The acquisition price was $115 million. Last year, Symantec joined the cloud storage and backup sector with its Enterprise Vault.cloud and Cloud Storage for Enterprise Vault solutions, in addition to a cloud messaging solution, Symantec Instant Messaging Security cloud (IMS.cloud). Symantec stated that the acquisition would add to its information governance products, allowing customers to store information on-premises, in Symantec's data centers, or both. Odyssey Software On March 2, 2012, Symantec completed the acquisition of Odyssey Software. Odyssey Software's main product was Athena, which was device management software that extended Microsoft System Center solutions, adding the ability to manage, support and control mobile and embedded devices, such as smartphones and ruggedized handhelds. Nukona Inc. Symantec completed its acquisition of Nukona, a provider of mobile application management (MAM), on April 2, 2012. The acquisition agreement between Symantec and Nukona was announced on March 20, 2012. The November 12, 2012 Vulnerability Bulletin of the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) reported the following vulnerability for older versions of Symantec's Antivirus system: ""The decomposer engine in Symantec Endpoint Protection (SEP) 11.0, Symantec Endpoint Protection Small Business Edition 12.0, Symantec AntiVirus Corporate Edition (SAVCE) 10.x, and Symantec Scan Engine (SSE) before 5.2.8 does not properly perform bounds checks of the contents of CAB archives, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted file."" This section requires expansion. (October 2015) Google also requested that Symantec state the reason for the breach involved against the framed industry policies. The company was asked to report all the certificates issued to the Certificate Transparency log henceforth. Symantec has since reported implementing Certificate Transparency for all its SSL Certificate. Above all, Google has insisted that Symantec execute a security audit by a third party and to maintain tamper-proof security audit logs."

Pay Less. Website www.target.com corporate.target.com Target Corporation is the second-largest discount retailer in the United States, behind Walmart, and is a component of the S&amp;P 500 Index. Founded by George Dayton and headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the company was originally named Goodfellow Dry Goods in June 1902 before being renamed the Dayton's Dry Goods Company in 1903 and later the Dayton Company in 1910. The first Target store opened in Roseville, Minnesota in 1962, while the parent company was renamed the Dayton Corporation in 1967. It became the Dayton-Hudson Corporation after merging with the J.L. Hudson Company in 1969, and held ownership of several department store chains including Dayton's, Hudson's, Marshall Field's, and Mervyn's. Wesfarmers began operating an Australian version of Target in 1973, although aside from naming rights, the American and Australian companies are unaffiliated. Target established itself as the highest-earning division of the Dayton-Hudson Corporation in the 1970s; it began expanding the store nationwide in the 1980s, and introduced new store formats under the Target branding in the 1990s. The parent company was renamed the Target Corporation in 2000, and divested itself of its last department store chains in 2004. It suffered from a highly publicized security breach of customer data and the failure of its short-lived Canadian subsidiary in the early 2010s, although experienced revitalized success with its expansion in urban markets the United States. As of 2015, Target operates 1,802 locations throughout the United States. Their retail formats include the discount store Target, the hypermarket SuperTarget, and ""flexible format"" stores previously named CityTarget and TargetExpress before being consolidated under the Target branding. Target is often recognized for its emphasis on ""the needs of its younger, image-conscious shoppers,"" whereas its rival Walmart more heavily relies on its strategy of ""always low prices."" Dayton-Hudson sold Lipman's to Marshall Field's (which rebranded them as Frederick &amp; Nelson) and acquired the discount store chain Ayr-Way in 1980, Later that year, Dayton-Hudson sold Lechmere to a group of investors (including Berkshire Partners). Present-day properties are roughly 135,000 square feet (12,500&#160;m2), and sell general merchandise including hardlines and softlines. Target introduced the ""PFresh"" store prototype in 2009, which expanded their grocery selection in general merchandise locations by an upwards of 200-percent. Newly constructed stores that follow the PFresh format are roughly 1,500 square feet (140&#160;m2) larger than properties without groceries, although retain the Target branding because their offerings are considerably more limited than SuperTarget. The company remodeled 109 stores accordingly in 2009, and renovated another 350 stores the following year. In the early 2000s, 43 locations (of nearly 100) featured E-Trade trading stations, although they were all closed by June 2003 after E-Trade determined that ""we were not able to make it into a profitable distribution channel."" they each encompass an estimate of 174,000 square feet (16,200&#160;m2). The exterior of the CityTarget in Boston, Massachusetts, now re-branded as Target. While typical Target locations are approximately 135,000 square feet (12,500&#160;m2), the majority of ""flexible format"" CityTarget stores are roughly 80,000 square feet (7,400&#160;m2). The first stores were opened in July 2012, in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Seattle; the 160,000 square feet (15,000&#160;m2) location in Boston is the largest CityTarget, and opened in July 2015. TargetExpress stores hover around 14,000 square feet (1,300&#160;m2) to 21,000 square feet (2,000&#160;m2); the first opened in Dinkytown near the University of Minnesota in July 2014. Financial and Retail Services (FRS) formerly Target Financial Services (TFS): issues Target's credit cards, known as the Target REDcard (formerly the Target Guest Card), issued through Target National Bank (formerly Retailers National Bank) for consumers and through Target Bank for businesses. Target Financial Services also oversees GiftCard balances. Target launched its PIN-x debit card, the Target Check Card, which was later re-branded the Target Debit Card. The Target Debit Card withdraws funds from the customer's existing checking account, and allows for up to $40 ""cash back."" The debit card allows customers to save five percent of each purchase, as well as designate a school for Target's Take Charge of Education program, and accumulate pharmacy rewards. Target Sourcing Services Target Sourcing Services (TSS): This global sourcing organization locates merchandise from around the world for Target and helps import the merchandise to the United States. Such merchandise include garments, furniture, bedding, and towels. TSS has 27 full-service offices, 48 quality-control offices, and seven concessionaires located throughout the world. TSS employs 1,200 people. Its engineers are responsible for evaluating the factories that do business with Target Corporation for quality, as well as labor rights and transshipment issues. Target opened three new distribution centers in 2006 (Rialto, California, DeKalb, Illinois) and one in 2009 (Newton, North Carolina) to support the growth of its stores. With the exception of vendor supplied items, such as greeting cards and soda, these distribution centers ship items directly to Target stores. Also, unlike Walmart, Target's grocery selection does not come from their own distribution centers, but from the companies with whom Target has partnered. The complex includes Target Plaza North and Target Plaza South. Ryan Companies developed the complex, and Ellerbe Becket served as the architect. Target had the approximately $260-million complex developed to provide one location of office space for 6,000 employees. The 14-story Target Plaza North has 600,000 square feet (56,000&#160;m2) of office and retail space, while the 32-story Target Plaza South has 1,250,000 square feet (116,000&#160;m2) of space. In February 2006 the National Federation of the Blind (NFB) filed a class action discrimination lawsuit in Northern California's Alameda County Superior Court, claiming that Target's commercial website contains ""thousands of access barriers that make it difficult, if not impossible, for blind customers to use."" On August 24, 2009, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a discrimination lawsuit against Target Corporation for unlawfully denying reasonable accommodation to an employee with multiple disability-based impairments and substantially reducing his work hours due to the medical conditions. According to the claims in the EEOC press release, Target's actions violated Title I of the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. According to a November 2005 Forbes article, it ranked as the highest cash-giving company in America in percentage of income given (2.1%). Target donates around 5 percent of its pre-tax operating profit; it gives over $3&#160;million a week (up from $2&#160;million in years prior) to the communities in which it operates. It also gives a percentage of charges from its Target Visa to schools designated by the cardholders. To date, Target has given over $150&#160;million to schools across the United States through this program. Further evidence of Target's philanthropy can be found in the Target House complex in Memphis, Tennessee, a long-term housing solution for families of patients at the city's St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The corporation led the way with more than $27&#160;million in donations, which made available 96 fully furnished apartments for families needing to stay at St. Jude over 90 days. Target has a no-solicitation rule at its properties, as it seeks to provide a ""distraction-free shopping experience for its guests."" Exemptions to this policy were previously made for the Salvation Army red kettles and bell-ringers outside Target stores during the holidays through Christmas. In 2004, however, Target asked the organization to explore alternate methods to partner with Target. Target donates to local Salvation Army chapters through its grant program and annually to the United Way of America (the Salvation Army is a member of the United Way coalition). In 2005, Target and the Salvation Army During disasters, Target has been a major benefactor for relief efforts. Target provided monetary and product donations during the September 11 attacks; it also donated money for relief efforts for the 2004 tsunami in South Asia and donated $1.5&#160;million (US) to the American Red Cross in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. It also allowed its store properties in the affected area to be used as command centers for relief organizations and donated supplies such as water and bug spray. Target will often donate its unused, returned or seasonal merchandise (particularly clothing) to Goodwill Industries.

Special attention is given to the design of the store environment: graphics reinforce its advertising imagery, while shelves are dressed with contemporary signage, backdrops and liners, often printed on inexpensive material such as paper, corrugated and foam boards. Some stores, particularly those in the vicinity of major airports, have a bullseye painted on the roof that can be seen from above: the stores in Atlanta, Georgia near Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport; Rosemont, Illinois, near O'Hare International Airport; Potomac Yard, Virginia, near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport; College Point, New York (Queens), east of LaGuardia Airport; and Richfield, Minnesota, adjacent to Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport are among such locations. by calling its customers ""Guests"", its employees ""Team Members"", and its supervisors ""Team Leaders"". Also, managers are known as ""Executive Team Leaders (ETLs)"" and the Store Manager is known as the ""Store Team Leader (STL)"". Further up the ""chain of command"" are ""District Team Leaders (DTL)"", ""Group Team Leaders (GTL)"", Regional Team Leaders (RTL) (sometimes also Regional Vice President), and finally corporate-level executives. Product lines and partnerships Past and current designs include lenticular, ""scratch and sniff"" (such as peppermint during the Christmas season), glow in the dark, LED light-up, a gift card on the side of a bubble blower, a gift card that can function as a CD-ROM, and even a giftcard that allows the sender to record a voice message. A current environmentally friendly giftcard is made from bioplastic manufactured from corn. Both patents have been assigned by their inventors to Target Brands, Inc. Target GiftCards are also collectors items. Some of the first gift cards issued are valued at over $300 (even though the card doesn't have any money on it). Every year Target introduces new Holiday GiftCards. In 2007, Target's Holiday GiftCards featured a wind-up flashlight, a musical gift card, a gift card that lights up, and a scented gift card.

The company was headquartered in Rochester until 1986, when it moved to Arlington County, Virginia. Its former headquarters building, the Gannett Building, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. On March 7, 2011, Gannett replaced the stylized ""G"" logo in use since the 1970s (notably used on its TV stations as a corporate/local ID with different animations), and adopted a new company tagline: ""It's all within reach."" Because of ownership conflicts that exist in markets where both Belo and Gannett own television stations and newspapers, the use of a third-party company (Sander Media, LLC, owned by former Belo executive Jack Sander) as a licensee to buy stations to be operated by the owner of a same-market competitor and concerns about any possible future consolidation of operations of Gannett- and Belo-owned properties in markets where both own television stations or collusion involving the Gannett and Sander stations in retransmission consent negotiations, anti-media-consolidation groups (such as Free Press) and pay television providers (such as Time Warner Cable and DirecTV) have called for the FCC to block the acquisition. On May 14, 2014, Gannett announced the acquisition of six stations from the Texas-based London Broadcasting Company in a $215 million deal, including KCEN-TV (NBC) in Waco-Temple-Bryan, KYTX (CBS) in Tyler-Longview, KIII (ABC) in Corpus Christi, KBMT (ABC/NBC) in Beaumont-Port Arthur, KXVA (FOX) in Abilene-Sweetwater and KIDY (FOX) in San Angelo. The company's COO Phil Hurley will also join Gannett to continue his leadership role at the six stations. 1906 - Elmira Gazette 1912 - The Ithaca Journal 1928 - Democrat and Chronicle 1971 - Federated Publications 1971 - Honolulu Star-Bulletin 1972 - Pacific and Southern Company, Inc (Taken over by Combined Communications) 1976 - Tucson Citizen 1983 - WTCN-TV (now KARE) from Metromedia and WLVI from Field Communications 1985 - Des Moines Register and Tribune Co. 2015 - Acquired remaining (56.36%) ownership in Texas-New Mexico Newspapers Partnerships, acquiring control of eleven papers in three states Main article: List of Gannett Company assets Gannett's media properties include the following newspapers among the top 100 (by circulation—figures are approximate) in the United States: USA Today of Tysons Corner, Virginia (1,830,594, 2nd overall) The Arizona Republic of Phoenix, Arizona (308,973, 14th) Detroit Free Press of Detroit, Michigan (245,326, 20th) The Indianapolis Star of Indianapolis, Indiana (182,933, 32nd) The Courier-Journal of Louisville, Kentucky (159,275, 42nd) The Cincinnati Enquirer of Cincinnati, Ohio (157,574, 43rd) The Tennessean of Nashville, Tennessee (127,538, 61st) Democrat and Chronicle of Rochester, New York (119,399, 65th) Asbury Park Press of Neptune City, New Jersey (112,683, 68th) The Des Moines Register of Des Moines, Iowa (109,095, 73rd) The News Journal of Wilmington, Delaware (87,138, 89th) The Journal News of White Plains, New York (79,525, 96th) Directors and senior executives ^ a b c d e f ""Gannett"".

After some scandals in the early 1990s (see below), NME divested its specialty facilities. Turn of the century (2000–13) In 2002, one of Tenet's hospitals came under scrutiny for its surgical practices and another was investigated in a kickback scheme (see below). Through the acquisition of Vanguard Health Systems, Tenet also acquired Abrazo Community Health Network the associated hospitals are located in Arizona. Acquisitions and other operations (2014) As of the fourth quarter 2014, Tenet has turned a profit, explained by higher admissions and revenue (admissions through Medicaid increased by 20.5% after the Affordable Care Act). Hospital admissions also saw an increase during the last quarter of 2014, while the company's bad debt expense ratio decreased. At the same time, its full year financial projections affirmed a price of $1.32 to $2.4 per share with revenue of $17.4 to $17.7 billion, Recent developments (2015-present) At the same time, Tenet announced an agreement to acquire a majority interest in United Surgical Partners International (USPI), which would make Tenet the largest operator of outpatient surgery centers in the United States. Tenet also announced an agreement to acquire Aspen Healthcare in Great Britain. Through its brands, subsidiaries, joint ventures, and partnerships with companies such as United Surgical Partners International (USPI), Tenet operates a total of nine facilities in the United Kingdom. Tenet also operates 400 outpatient centers in the United States, Tenet-operated hospitals include four academic medical centers, two children’s hospitals, three specialty hospitals (one of which is temporarily closed for repairs) In the late 1990s through the early 2000s, Redding Medical Center (at the time, a Tenet-owned hospital), was investigated for performing unnecessary heart surgeries on over 600 patients. To settle these allegations, Tenet agreed to pay a $54&#160;million fine to the federal government and the state of California, without admitting wrongdoing. This settlement did not preclude civil or criminal charges against individuals of the company. In June 2006, Tenet agreed to pay $725&#160;million in cash and give up $175&#160;million of Medicare payments for a total of $900&#160;million in fees to resolve claims it defrauded the federal government for over-billing Medicare claims during the 1990s. To finance the settlement, they sold 11 hospitals in four states including Memorial Medical Center (see below)."

Texas Instruments was founded by Cecil H. Green, J. Erik Jonsson, Eugene McDermott, and Patrick E. Haggerty in 1951. McDermott was one of the original founders of Geophysical Service Inc. (GSI) in 1930. McDermott, Green, and Jonsson were GSI employees who purchased the company in 1941. In November, 1945, Patrick Haggerty was hired as general manager of the Laboratory and Manufacturing (L&amp;M) division. By 1951, the L&amp;M division, with its defense contracts, was growing faster than GSI's Geophysical division. The company was reorganized and initially renamed General Instruments Inc. Because there already existed a firm named General Instrument, the company was renamed Texas Instruments that same year. From 1956 to 1961, Fred Agnich of Dallas, later a Republican member of the Texas House of Representatives, was the Texas Instruments president. Geophysical Service, Inc. became a subsidiary of Texas Instruments. Early in 1988 most of GSI was sold to the Halliburton Company. Texas Instruments exists to create, make and market useful products and services to satisfy the needs of its customers throughout the world. TI's new signboard at its Dallas headquarters In 1930, J. Clarence Karcher and Eugene McDermott founded Geophysical Service, an early provider of seismic exploration services to the petroleum industry. In 1939 the company reorganized as Coronado Corp., an oil company with Geophysical Service Inc (GSI), now as a subsidiary. On December 6, 1941, McDermott along with three other GSI employees, J. Erik Jonsson, Cecil H. Green, and H.B. Peacock purchased GSI. During World War II, GSI expanded their services to include electronics for the U.S. Army, Signal Corps, and the U.S. Navy. In 1951 the company changed its name to Texas Instruments, GSI becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the new company. An early success story for TI-GSI came in 1965 when GSI was able (under a Top Secret government contract) to monitor the Soviet Union's underground nuclear weapons testing under the ocean in Vela Uniform, a subset of Project Vela, to verify compliance of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Texas Instruments also continued to manufacture equipment for use in the seismic industry, and GSI continued to provide seismic services. After selling (and repurchasing) GSI, TI finally sold the company to Halliburton in 1988, at which point GSI ceased to exist as a separate entity. Defense electronics Texas Instruments operated this Convair 240 on experimental work in the 1980s fitted with a modified extended nose section Texas Instruments entered the defense electronics market in 1942 with submarine detection equipment, based on the seismic exploration technology previously developed for the oil industry. The division responsible for these products was known at different points in time as the Laboratory &amp; Manufacturing Division, the Apparatus Division, the Equipment Group and the Defense Systems &amp; Electronics Group (DSEG). During the early 1980s Texas Instruments instituted a quality program which included Juran training, as well as promoting statistical process control, Taguchi methods and Design for Six Sigma. In the late '80s, the company, along with Eastman Kodak and Allied Signal, began involvement with Motorola institutionalizing Motorola's Six Sigma methodology. A Bolt-117, the first laser-guided bomb built by Texas Instruments. An AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon. TI developed the AAA-4 infra-red search and track (IRST) in the late 50's and early 60's for the F-4B Phantom In 1956 TI began research on infrared technology that led to several line scanner contracts and with the addition of a second scan mirror the invention of the first forward looking infrared (FLIR) in 1963 with production beginning in 1966. In 1972 TI invented the Common Module FLIR concept, greatly reducing cost and allowing reuse of common components. TI went on to produce side-looking radar systems, the first terrain following radar and surveillance radar systems for both the military and FAA. TI demonstrated the first solid-state radar called Molecular Electronics for Radar Applications (MERA). In 1976 TI developed a microwave landing system prototype. In 1984 TI developed the first inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR). The first single-chip gallium arsenide radar module was developed. In 1991 the Military Microwave Integrated Circuit (MIMIC) program was initiated&#160;– a joint effort with Raytheon. In 1961 TI won the guidance and control system contract for the defense suppression AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missile. This led later to the prime on the High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile (AGM-88 HARM) development contract in 1974 and production in 1981. In 1964 TI began development of the first laser guidance system for precision-guided munitions (PGM) leading to the Paveway series of laser-guided bombs (LGBs). The first LGB was the BOLT-117. In 1969 TI won the Harpoon (missile) Seeker contract. In 1986 TI won the Army FGM-148 Javelin fire-and-forget man portable anti-tank guided missile in a joint venture with Martin Marietta. In 1991 TI was awarded the contract for the AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW). Military computers"

In 1896 Milton built a milk-processing plant so he could create and refine a recipe for milk chocolate candies. In 1899 he developed the Hershey process which is less sensitive to milk quality than traditional methods, and in 1900 he began manufacturing Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars, also called Hershey's Bars or Hershey Bars. Hershey's Cocoa ad from 1918. Hershey, Pennsylvania Today 80 million of the candies are produced each day. Other products introduced included Mr. Goodbar (1925), containing peanuts in milk chocolate, Hershey's Syrup (1926), semi-sweet chocolate chips (1928), and the Krackel bar containing crisped rice (1938). Labor troubles Shortly before World War II, Bruce Murrie, son of long-time Hershey's president William F.R. Murrie struck a deal with Forrest Mars to create a hard sugar-coated chocolate that would be called M&amp;M's (for Mars and Murrie). Murrie had 20% interest in the confection, which used Hershey chocolate during the rationing era during World War II. In 1948 Mars bought out Murrie's interest and became one of Hershey's main competitors. In 1988 Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelēz International). In 2015 they sued a British importer to halt imports of British Cadbury chocolate, angering consumers. Milton Hershey School (MHS) This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (November 2013) Main article: Milton Hershey School Unable to have children of his own, Milton S. Hershey founded the Milton Hershey School in 1909 for orphans. In 1918, Milton S. Hershey and his wife, Catherine Hershey, donated all of their considerable wealth, of around 60 million dollars, to the boarding school upon Catherine Hershey's death. The Hershey Trust Company is now the largest shareholder and beneficiary to the School. Before his death, Milton Hershey ensured the school would live on by donating 30% of all future Hershey profits to the school. Due to this generous donation by America's largest chocolate company, MHS now has over 7 billion dollars in assets, making it one of the richest schools in the world. Today, the Milton Hershey School provides free education, health care, counseling and a friendly home to 2000 orphans in financial need. The school's programs include sports, arts, religious studies, sciences, math, language and many other subjects. School colors are gold and brown. Students must wear a uniform to class provided to them by the School to encourage equality. Their admissions is primarily based on age and financial need for the orphans. The school also provides ""House Parents"", which are hired couples, paid to take care of and nurture the students. The school's ""fellowship"" project provides students with Hershey employee visits to build long lasting relationships and provide career counseling. Additionally, the school is located in Hershey, Pennsylvania, a city created by Milton Hershey himself. The city offers security, a church, a post office and other services for the students. Many of its designs resemble Hershey chocolate products, such as the Hershey Kisses light posts. Most notably perhaps is the fact that Mr. Milton Hershey prohibited The Hershey Company from using the School as an advertisement or marketing strategy. The school's primary goal is to provide young orphans with the skills necessary to support themselves and their families in the future. Manufacturing plants In 1969, Hershey received a license from Rowntree's to manufacture and market Kit Kat and Rolo in the United States. As of September 2013, Hershey continued to make and market these brands in the U.S. under license from Nestlé, owners of the Rowntree brand. In 1977, Hershey acquired Y&amp;S Candies, founded in 1845, and became the makers of Twizzlers licorice candies. In 1986, Hershey's began a brief foray into cough drops when it acquired the Luden's cough drops brand. But by 2001, the brand had been sold to Pharmacia (now part of Pfizer), Hershey's kept Luden's 5th Avenue bar. In 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondelēz International). In 1996, Hershey purchased the American operations of the Leaf Candy Company from Huhtamäki. In 1999, the Hershey Pasta Group was divested to several equity partners to form the New World Pasta company (now part of Ebro Foods). On July 25, 2002 it became public knowledge that the Hershey Trust Company was seeking to sell its controlling interest in the Hershey Foods Corporation. The value of Hershey stock skyrocketed 25% with over 19 million shares trading that day. But over the following 55 days, widespread press coverage, as well as pressure from Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher, the community of Hershey, and Dauphin County Orphans' Court Senior Judge Warren G. Morgan, led to the sale being abandoned. The seven Hershey trustees who voted to sell Hershey Foods on September 17, 2002, for US$12.5 billion to the William Wrigley Jr. Company (now part of Mars Incorporated) were removed by Attorney General Fisher and Judge Morgan. In July 1998, a number of 100 g (3.5&#160;oz) milk chocolate bars being sold for fund raising events were recalled because they may have contained traces of almonds not listed in the ingredients. Exel in turn subcontracted the staffing of the center to another firm SHS OnSite Solutions based in Lemoyne, Pennsylvania. The students were recruited by yet another organization called the Council on Educational Travel (CETUSA). Hershey's filed a lawsuit against Let's Buy British Imports, and Posh Nosh Imports because of the aforementioned companies importation of Nestlé's Yorkie, and Toffee Crisp, for Hershey's claim of alleged resemblance to York Peppermint Patties and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, respectively; despite the fact that Hershey's and Nestlé's respective products are different types of candy. Hershey also claimed that import of original British Rolo by Nestlé violated its licensed rights to the Rolo brand in the US, and sought the end of importation of Rolo into the US. Hershey's also sought the halting of the importation of British, South African, Canadian, Australian, New Zealander, and all other Cadbury brand chocolate other than Hershey's licensed chocolate product produced in the US and marketed under the Cadbury brand name. Hershey's claimed that the importers, LBB Importers and Posh Nosh, were infringing on their rights to the Cadbury brand name in the US due to their licensing agreement with Cadbury, a division of Mondelez. In addition, Hershey's claimed that the two importers needed to stop importing Mars's Maltesers malted milk balls because Hershey's makes their own malted milk balls under the Maltesers name. Hershey's itself has been sued by Mars for violating Mars' trademark and rights to Maltesers, Mars has said that Hershey's has copied Maltesers brand, packaging, and products; that lawsuit has not settled as of 16 February 2015. In January 2015, Hershey's lawsuit against Let's Buy British Imports and Posh Nosh Imports was dropped, and the two importers agreed to stop importing non-licensed original Cadbury chocolate, Nestlé's Yorkie chocolate and Toffee Crisp, and Maltesers. This decision was immediately met with immense backlash and controversy against Hershey. Many people said that they would no longer purchase Hershey's products, as many believe that the taste of British chocolate such as Cadburys etc. was much superior to that of American chocolate such as Hershey's in particular and many called for a boycott of Hershey's products. A petition protesting Hershey's lawsuit has gained over 35,000 signatures as of 16 February 2015. An owner of a 7/11 in a Boston neighborhood with heavy Irish immigrant presence said that he would stop carrying Hershey products in his store, as have other stores across the country. Some people purchased hundreds of the mentioned products with news of the lawsuit. The lawsuit does not prevent other importers of the chocolates from importing them as they were not mentioned in the lawsuit."

Bottom: The logo that The St. Paul used prior to the merger with Travelers. The main predecessor companies of The Travelers Companies, Inc. are The St. Paul Companies, Inc. and Travelers Property Casualty Corporation. Saint Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co. was founded March 5, 1853, in St. Paul, Minnesota, serving local customers who were having a difficult time getting claim payments in a timely manner from insurance companies on the east coast of the United States. It barely survived the Panic of 1857 by dramatically paring down its operations and later reorganizing itself into a stock company (as opposed to a mutual company). It soon spread its operations across the country. In 1998 it acquired USF&amp;G, known formerly as United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, an insurance company based in Baltimore, Maryland, but was forced to downsize by almost half due to a competitive marketplace. Notably, many of Travelers' ancestor companies, such as St. Paul and USF&amp;G, are still around today and still write policies and accept claims, but only on paper. As is typical of most insurers in the United States, Travelers never dissolved the various companies it acquired, but simply made them wholly owned subsidiaries and trained its employees to act on behalf of those subsidiaries. This is a common risk management strategy used by U.S. insurance groups. If any one company in the group gets hit with too many claims, the situation can be easily contained to that one company (which is placed in runoff and allowed to run its policies to completion), while the remainder of the group continues to operate normally.

(July 2013) Tiffany &amp; Company's flagship store Tiffany &amp; Company's store in Toronto Since 1940, Tiffany's flagship store has operated at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 57th Street in Manhattan, New York City, U.S. The polished granite exterior is well known for its window displays, and the store has been the location for a number of films, including Breakfast at Tiffany's, starring Audrey Hepburn, and Sweet Home Alabama, starring Reese Witherspoon. The former Tiffany and Company Building on 37th Street is on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. When it opened in 1990, the Tiffany &amp; Co. store at Fairfax Square in Tysons Corner, Virginia, U.S. became the largest outside of New York City, with 14,500&#160;sq&#160;ft (1,350&#160;m2) of retail space. In the United Kingdom (UK), Tiffany stores are located in Terminal 5, at London's Heathrow airport (opened at the end of March 2008), in the Westfield London shopping centre in Shepherd's Bush, and in Old Bond Street, opposite the entrance to Burlington Gardens. A flagship Irish store was opened in Brown Thomas on Dublin's Grafton Street in October 2008 and is the largest of the company's European outlets. Also in October 2008, Tiffany's opened a store in Madrid, Spain, and brought the Tiffany Yellow Diamond (pictured at right) to the opening. In Australia, Tiffany &amp; Company's flagship store is located on Collins Street in Melbourne. Other stores include Chadstone Shopping Centre (Melbourne); Sydney (Castlereagh Street, Westfield Bondi Junction and DFS Galleria on George Street); Brisbane (Queens Plaza); and Perth (King Street). Tiffany &amp; Co. announced its second store opening at Pavilion Kuala Lumpur in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in September 2007 to coincide with the shopping mall's opening. The store consists of 1,700&#160;sq&#160;ft (160&#160;m2) retail space and features the same decor elements as the New York City flagship store. Later that year, other stores were opened in the U.S., such as the Natick Collection in Natick, Massachusetts, U.S., which opened in September 2007, and Mohegan Sun Erika's casino in Connecticut, U.S, and the Providence Place mall in Providence, Rhode Island, U.S., both of which opened in November 2007. The 128.54 carats (25.708&#160;g) Tiffany Yellow Diamond is usually on display in the New York City flagship store. Marilyn Monroe performing ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"", in which Tiffany is mentioned twice (1953) Hepburn in the opening scene of the iconic Breakfast at Tiffany's. In the 1948 movie Ladies of the Chorus, Tiffany's is mentioned in the song ""Every Baby Needs a Da-Da-Daddy"", which is sung by Marilyn Monroe. In 1953 the singer Eartha Kitt recorded a Christmas song titled Santa Baby in which decorations from Tiffany's are mentioned. In the 1953 movie Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Tiffany's is mentioned twice in the song ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"", which is sung by Marilyn Monroe . In the 1956's James Bond novel, Diamonds Are Forever, one of Bond's love interests is named Tiffany Case. In the 1971 film of the same name, the character explains that she is named after Tiffany &amp; Co. (and has the distinction of being the first American Bond girl). In Truman Capote's novella, Breakfast at Tiffany's (1958), the title is a reference to the store. One of the protagonists in the novella, Holly Golightly, constantly refers to the store as ""the best place in the world, where nothing bad can take place."" The iconic 1961 film of the same name (starring Audrey Hepburn) was based on Capote's novella. The second verse of The Eagles' 1976 song ""Hotel California"" begins with the line ""Her mind is Tiffany-twisted"". Tiffany's is briefly mentioned in the 1987 film Full Metal Jacket when GySgt Hartman disciplines Gomer Pyle saying ""Private Pyle you had best square your ass away and start shitting me Tiffany cufflinks or I will definitely fuck you up!"" In the movie Sleepless in Seattle (1993), a long scene takes place first outside, then inside Tiffany &amp; Co. showing Meg Ryan and Bill Pullman's characters picking out china and him presenting her with his mother's resized wedding ring.

(TWI, at one former interval named AOL Time Warner, stylized as TimeWarner since 2003) is an American Multinational media and entertainment conglomerate headquartered in the Time Warner Center in New York City. It is currently the world's third largest television networks and filmed TV &amp; entertainment company in terms of revenue (after Comcast and The Walt Disney Company), and at one time was the world's largest media conglomerate. Time Warner was formed in 1990 through the merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The current company consists largely of the assets of the former Warner Communications, as well as HBO (a Time Inc. subsidiary prior to the Warner merger) and the assets of Turner Broadcasting (acquired in 1996). Time Warner currently has major operations in film and television, with a limited amount of publishing operations. Among its assets are New Line Cinema, HBO, Turner Broadcasting System, The CW Television Network, Warner Bros., Cartoon Network, Boomerang, Adult Swim, CNN, DC Comics, Warner Bros. Animation, Cartoon Network Studios, Hanna-Barbera, Esporte Interativo, Castle Rock Entertainment and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.

Turner brands include CNN, HLN, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, Turner Classic Movies, truTV, Turner Sports, and more. Turner’s brands and sub brands reach broad domestic and international audiences. It was the holding company for Warner Bros. Pictures and Warner Music Group during the 1970s and 1980s. It also owned DC Comics and Mad, as well as a majority stake in Garden State National Bank (an investment it was ultimately required to sell pursuant to requirements under the Bank Holding Company Act). Warner's initial divestiture efforts led by Garden State CEO Charles A. Agemian were blocked by Garden State board member William A. Conway in 1978; a revised transaction was later completed in 1980. In 1975, Home Box Office became the first TV network to broadcast nationally via satellite, debuting with the Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier “Thrilla in Manila” boxing match. In 1975, Warner expanded under the guidance of CEO Steve Ross and formed a joint venture with American Express, named Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, which held cable channels including MTV (launched 1981), Nickelodeon (launched 1979) and The Movie Channel. Warner Bros. bought out American Express's half in 1984, and sold the venture a year later to Viacom, which renamed it MTV Networks. In 1976, the Turner–owned WTCG originated the ""superstation"" concept, transmitting via satellite to cable systems nationwide and pioneering the basic cable business model. WTCG was renamed WTBS in 1979. In 1976, Nolan Bushnell sold Atari, Inc. to Warner Communications for an estimated $2–12 million. Warner made considerable profits (and later losses) with Atari, which it owned from 1976 to 1984. While part of Warner, Atari achieved its greatest success, selling millions of Atari 2600s and computers. At its peak, Atari accounted for a third of Warner's annual income and was the fastest-growing company in the history of the United States at the time. In 1980, Warner purchased The Franklin Mint for about $225 million. The combination was short lived: Warner sold The Franklin Mint in 1985 to American Protection Industries Inc. (API) for $167.5 million. However, Warner retained Franklin Mint’s Eastern Mountain Sports as well as The Franklin Mint Center, which it leased back to API. During the summer of that same year, Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western) launched a $12.2 billion hostile bid to acquire Time, Inc. in an attempt to end a stock-swap merger deal between Time and Warner Communications. This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to $14.9 Billion in cash and stock. Paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time/Warner merger. The court ruled twice in favor of Time, forcing Paramount to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit, and allowing the formation of the two companies' merger which was completed on January 10, 1990. However, instead of the companies becoming defunct, the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure, resulting in the new company being called ""Time Warner"". 1990s US West partnered with Time Warner in 1993 to form what is now known as TW Telecom, initially known as Time Warner Communications (also utilized as the brand name for cable operation previously under the ATC name), in order to bring telephone via fiber to the masses. US West also took a 26% stake in the entertainment portion of the company, calling that division Time Warner Entertainment (or legally Time Warner Entertainment Company L.P.). US West's stake eventually passed to acquired cable company MediaOne, then to AT&amp;T Broadband in 1999 when that company acquired MediaOne, then finally to Comcast in 2001 when that company bought the AT&amp;T Broadband division. Comcast sold their stake in the company in 2003, relegating the name to a subdivision under Time Warner Cable. Time Warner subsequently acquired Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System in October 1996. Not only did this result in the company (in a way) re-entering the basic cable television industry (in regards to nationally available channels), but Warner Bros. also regained the rights to their pre-1950 film library, which by then had been owned by Turner (the films are still technically held by Turner, but WB is responsible for sales and distribution). AOL Time Warner, Inc., as the company was then called, was supposed to be a merger of equals with top executives from both sides. Gerald Levin, who had served as CEO of Time Warner, was CEO of the new company. Steve Case served as Executive Chairman of the board of directors, Robert W. Pittman (President and COO of AOL) and Dick Parsons (President of Time Warner) served as Co-Chief Operating Officers, and J. Michael Kelly (the CFO from AOL) became the Chief Financial Officer. In June 2014, 21st Century Fox made a bid for Time Warner at $85 per share in stock and cash ($80 billion total) which Time Warner's board of directors turned down in July. Warner's CNN unit would have been sold to ease antitrust issues of the purchase. On March 17, 2009, Time Warner Inc. announced the legal and structural separation of Time Warner Cable Inc. (NYSE:TWC) from Time Warner through a tax-free spin-off that had become effective on March 12, 2009. In the first quarter of 2010, Home Box Office purchased additional interests in HBO LAG for $217 million, which resulted in Home Box Office owning 80% of the equity interests of HBO LAG.In 2010, Home Box Office purchased the remainder of its partners’ interests in HBO Europe (formerly HBO Central Europe) for $136 million, net of cash acquired. On April 20, 2010, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group announced the acquisition of Turbine, Inc., Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (“CME”) is a publicly traded broadcasting company operating leading networks in six Central and Eastern European countries. On May 18, 2009, the company In August 2012, Turner acquired Bleacher Report, (B/R), a sports news organization. On March 6, 2013, Time Warner announced the divestment of Time Inc."

It is shared by its namesake, but now unrelated company, Time Warner. Time Warner Cable building entrance in Morrisville, North Carolina Time Warner Cable (TWC) is an American cable telecommunications company. It is the second largest cable company in the U.S. by revenue behind only Comcast, operating in 29 states. Originally controlled by Warner Communications, later Time Warner (the film and television production company and cable channel operator), that company spun off the cable operations in March 2009 as part of a larger restructuring. Since then, Time Warner Cable has been an entirely independent company, merely continuing to use the Time Warner brand under license from its former parent (it also previously used the ""Road Runner"" name for its internet service). In 2014, the company was the subject of a proposed purchase by Comcast Corporation, valued at $45.2 billion; however, following opposition to the deal by various groups, along with plans by the U.S. government to try and block the merger, Comcast called off the deal in April 2015. On May 26, 2015, Charter Communications announced that it would acquire Time Warner Cable for $78.7 billion, along with Bright House Networks in a separate $10.1 billion deal, pending regulatory approval. Charter expected to complete the former transaction by the end of 2015.

(service areas previously belonging to that company went under the Time Warner Communications name; since the 1990s, areas that previously had that name have either been renamed to Time Warner Cable, Bright House Networks, or have been given to other cable providers), and Warner Cable, a division of Warner Communications, as a result of a merger to form Time Warner; for the two years after the initial merger, both companies operated separately but under the umbrella name ""Time Warner Cable Group""; they formally merged into one entity in 1992. It also includes the remnants of the defunct QUBE interactive TV service. In 1995, the company launched the Southern Tier On-Line Community, a cable modem service later known as Road Runner High Speed Online. That same year, talks began that would later result in Warner's acquisition of Paragon Cable. Glenn Britt (1949–2014) Non-Time Warner shareholders received 0.083670 shares for each share already owned. This move made Time Warner Cable the largest cable operator in the United States owned solely by a single class of shareholders (without supervoting stock). As of 2013, Time Warner Cable's business division had the second largest business-facing enterprise by revenue (of cable providers who offer business services), with $1.7 billion in revenue as of the third quarter of 2013. Total revenue for 2012 was $1.9 billion. Main article: Time Warner Cable Internet As of 2014, Time Warner Cable's broadband service was available to over 66.9 million people across 29 states, making it the 2nd largest provider of cable broadband in the US (Based on coverage area). In addition to Adelphia's coverage being divided up, Time Warner Cable and Comcast also agreed to exchange some of their own subscribers in order to consolidate key regions. An example of this is the Los Angeles market, which was mostly covered by Comcast and Adelphia (and some areas of the region already served by TWC), is now under Time Warner Cable. Philadelphia, previously was split between Time Warner and Comcast, with the majority of cable subscribers belonging to Comcast. Time Warner subscribers in Philadelphia were swapped with Comcast in early 2007. Similarly, the Houston area, which was under Time Warner, was swapped to Comcast, while the Dallas metro area was changed to Time Warner (RR). Time Warner Cable purchased NaviSite (NAVI), a company providing cloud and hosting services, on February 1, 2011 for $230 million, roughly equating to $5.50 per share. Advance/Newhouse and Time Warner (Bright House Networks spin off) Some of the regional cable system clusters operated by Time Warner Cable are owned by the Time Warner Entertainment – Advance/Newhouse Partnership (TWEAN). In 2002, Advance/Newhouse Communications, unhappy with some of the operating policies of Time Warner Cable in the AOL Time Warner era, forced a restructuring of the TWEAN partnership such that Advance/Newhouse would actively manage and operate a portion of the jointly owned cable systems equal to their percentage of equity. Under this arrangement, Advance/Newhouse enjoys the proceeds of their actively managed systems rather than simply a percentage of the partnership's total earnings. The majority of the affected systems are in the Tampa and Orlando markets under the Bright House Networks brand. The value of this deal is that it allows Advance/Newhouse to more directly control their cable investments without having to completely unravel the TWEAN partnership, which does bring some benefits via Time Warner's development and purchasing clout. If the transactions proposed by Charter are approved, TWC and Bright House Networks will be absorbed into Charter. Time Warner Cable ident used until 2010.

Transocean started in the 1970s as a whaling company and expanded through a series of mergers. The new company was called Transocean Offshore. The new company began building massive drilling operations with drills capable of going to 10,000&#160;feet (as opposed to 3,000&#160;feet at the time) and operating two drill operations on the same ship. Its first ship, Discoverer Enterprise, cost nearly US$430 million and was 834&#160;ft (254&#160;m). Sedco Forex had been formed from a merger of two drilling companies, the Southeastern Drilling Company (Sedco), founded in 1947 by Bill Clements and acquired by Schlumberger in 1985 for $1 billion  and French drilling company Forages et Exploitations Pétrolières (Forex) founded in 1942 in German occupied France for drilling in North Africa. In 2005, the company's Discoverer Spirit rig set a world record for the deepest offshore oil and gas well of 34,189&#160;ft (10,421&#160;m). In September 2009, its Deepwater Horizon rig established a 35,050&#160;ft (10,680&#160;m) well, the deepest well in history – more than 5,000&#160;feet deeper than its stated design specification.

(January 2012) Main article: Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion On April 20, 2010, a fire was reported on a Transocean-owned semisubmersible drilling rig, Deepwater Horizon. Deepwater Horizon was a Reading &amp; Bates Falcon RBS8D design, a firm that was acquired by Transocean in 2001. The fire broke out at 10:00&#160;p.m. CDT UTC−5 in US waters of Mississippi Canyon 252 in the Gulf of Mexico. The rig was 41&#160;mi (66&#160;km) off the Louisiana coast. The US Coast Guard launched a rescue operation after the explosion which killed 11 workers and critically injured seven of the 126 member crew. Offshore drilling leak off the Brazilian coast (2011) The offshore drilling facility ""Frade"", operated by Transocean under contract from Chevron, began to leak in November 2011. Oil began leaking from the seabed at a depth of approximately 1100 to 1200m. Damage included an oil slick (oil floating on the ocean surface) covering an area of approximately 80&#160;km2 and growing. This put the oil at a distance of about 370&#160;km from Rio de Janeiro, but other beautiful beaches are much closer (estimated 140&#160;km). The Brazilian government sued Transocean and attempted to force the company to cease operations in Brazil, but a settlement was reached without a finding of fault or liability."

It also includes interactive travel forums. TripAdvisor was an early adopter of user-generated content. The website services are free to users, who provide most of the content, and the website is supported by an advertising business model. Holiday Lettings, Holiday Watchdog, Independent Traveler, Jetsetter, lafourchette, Niumba, OneTime, SeatGuru, SmarterTravel, Tingo, Travel Library, TravelPod, Viator, and VirtualTourist. TripAdvisor operates websites internationally, in such places as Austria, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China (under the brand 猫途鹰 www.tripadvisor.cn), Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, The Netherlands,Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Serbia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, the U.K., and the U.S. History In September 2010, SmarterTravel, part of TripAdvisor Media Group, launched SniqueAway (now Jetsetter), the first members-only site where each travel deal is endorsed by the people. In July 2014, TrpAdvisor announced its acquisition of La Fourchette (thefork.com) for $240M The website also allows the community of users to report suspicious content, which is then assessed by a team of quality assurance specialists, and TripAdvisor alerts the owner or manager of a TripAdvisor-listed establishment whenever a review is posted on their listing. In September 2011, the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) launched a formal investigation into TripAdvisor after receiving complaints that its claims to provide trustworthy and honest reviews from travelers are false. The outcome of this case was called a ""landmark victory"", as the pursuer (plaintiff) secured two points of law in the UK: TripAdvisor conceded that it could be sued in the UK's jurisdictions (having previously claimed to be outside the remit of the Scottish legal system because it is based in Massachusetts); TripAdvisor's terms of use constituted a contract, which was actionable/enforceable by the business being reviewed. The case was found to involve issues relating to the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Act, 1977: these issues were referred to a higher court in Stornoway. In 2012, TripAdvisor was fined $80,000 by the U.S. Department of Transportation for violating new fair trading regulations requiring taxes and fees to be shown for prices quoted for airfares."

(NYSE:&#160;TSN) is an American multinational corporation based in Springdale, Arkansas, that operates in the food industry. The company is the world's largest processor and marketer of chicken, beef, and pork and annually exports the largest percentage of beef out of the United States. With 2011 sales of US$32&#160;billion, Tyson Foods is the second-largest food production company in the Fortune 500, the second largest meat producer in the world, and according to Forbes, one of the 100 largest companies in the United States. Tyson has donated millions of dollars in cash to help non-profit organizations across the country.

Using a hidden camera, he allegedly documented the treatment of the more than 100,000 chickens killed every day in the plant. PETA alleges that workers were instructed to rip the heads off of birds who missed the throat-cutting machines. He claims he saw birds scalded alive in the feather removal tank, and he said that managers said that it was acceptable to scald 40 birds alive per shift. The investigator claims plant employees were also seen throwing around dead birds just for fun. PETA has asked Tyson to implement controlled atmosphere killing (CAK). For this reason, PETA is boycotting businesses that use Tyson as a supplier, such as KFC and distribution channels such as Sunset Strips. The video, taken by the investigator of the killings, was posted on YouTube."

Tyco International plc Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;TYC S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Security Founded 1960 incorporated 1962 Headquarters Incorporation: Cork, Ireland Operational/Corporate: Princeton, NJ, United States Key people George R. Oliver (CEO) Edward D. Breen (Chairman) Products Security Solutions, Fire Protection Revenue US$17.36 billion (2011) Operating income US$2,119 million (2011) Net income US$1,733 million (2011) Number of employees 69,000 (2011) Tyco International Ltd. is an American security systems company incorporated in Delaware, with New Jersey operational headquarters in Princeton, NJ (Tyco International (US) Inc.). Tyco International is composed of two major business segments: Security Solutions and Fire Protection. In June 2007, Tyco concluded a corporate separation that split the company into three publicly independent companies: Covidien Ltd. (formerly Tyco Healthcare), TE Connectivity Ltd. (formerly Tyco Electronics Ltd.) and Tyco International Ltd. (formerly Tyco Fire &amp; Security and Tyco Engineered Products &amp; Services (TFS/TEPS)). Tyco International announced in January 2011 that it is acquiring Brink's Home Security Holdings, (operating as Broadview Security) in a transaction valued at $2.0 billion. In 1974, Tyco was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Following aggressive acquisition period through the 1970s, Tyco management focused the early 1980s on organizing its newly acquired subsidiaries. Tyco divided the company into three business segments (Fire Protection, Electronics, and Packaging), and implemented strategies to achieve significant market share in each of Tyco’s product lines. A TYCO Standard Spray Sprinkler head In 1992, Dennis Kozlowski became CEO of Tyco International, and, for the next several years, the company again adopted an aggressive acquisition strategy, eventually acquiring (by some accounts) over 1,000 other companies between 1991 and 2001. For all the acquisitions Tyco made in 2002, the company also incurred extensive losses. During the first quarter of 2002, following the recession of the previous year, the electronics segment recorded a charge of over $2 billion, related to massive overcapacity of fiber-optic cable, which in turn affected the in-process buildout of Tyco's global undersea fiber-optic network, known as Tyco Global Network (TGN). TGN generated a loss for fiscal 2002 of over $3 billion, with a restructuring charge of over $500 million. Construction of TGN was eventually completed in 2003. On November 27, 2002, the State of New Jersey took action in the scandal, filing a federal suit against Tyco and former personnel, with charges in part of violating the New Jersey Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) statute, stemming from the Kozlowski scandal. As a result of the scandal, Tyco and some former directors and officers were named as defendants in more than two dozen securities class-action lawsuits. Most of the cases were consolidated and transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire and filed by court-appointed lead plaintiffs on January 28, 2003, as the case In Re Tyco International Securities Litigation, citing causes of action under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. That March 31, Tyco made a motion to dismiss, which was granted in part over a year later, on October 14, 2004. Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL), India acquired the Tyco Global Network (TGN) from Tyco International for $130 million. The chief stockholder in VSNL is India's Tata Group, also one of India's largest conglomerates. It was once valued at $3 billion during the telecommunications bubble. Tyco was awarded the largest statewide public safety communications project in the United States in 2004 when one of Tyco Electronics’ businesses, M/A-COM, signed a contract to maintain New York's Statewide Wireless Network (SWN). The contract was worth approximately $2 billion and would last for 20 years. Tyco also acquired two key companies to its Healthcare segment, Vivant Medical Inc. and Floréane Medical Implants. Covidien Ltd. (formerly Tyco Healthcare) Tyco Electronics Ltd. (now TE Connectivity) Tyco International Ltd. (formerly Tyco Fire &amp; Security and Tyco Engineered Products &amp; Services (TFS/TEPS)) Following the separation, Chairman and CEO Ed Breen remained at the head of Tyco International, which is now composed of five major business segments: ADT Worldwide, Fire Protection Services, Safety Products, Flow Control and Electrical and Metal Products. The company generated revenue of $18.8 billion in 2007 and employs 118,000 people across all 50 states and in more than 60 countries. The separation was completed on October 1, 2012, resulting in the following companies being created: Tyco: Focused on fire protection and electronic security products, installation and services worldwide. The ADT Corporation in North America: Focused on residential and small business security installation and services in North America. Flow Control: Focused on water and fluid solutions, valves and controls, and equipment protection products worldwide. This business merged with Pentair Inc. and is now part of Pentair Ltd. The new Tyco is a $10+ billion global leader in fire protection and security solutions and provides the following solutions: life safety products, fire protection products, fire protection installation and services, security products and security installation and services. Tyco retains use of the ADT brand for security installation and services outside of North America. ADT’s commercial security installation and services business in North America was rebranded and is now Tyco Integrated Security. Tyco has over 70,000 employees worldwide, operating in nearly 50 countries and serves over three million customers. In September 2012, Tyco was accused of violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and agreed in a payment of around $13 million in civil penalties to the Securities Exchange Commission. Former chairman and chief executive Dennis Kozlowski and former chief financial officer Mark H. Swartz were accused of the theft of more than US$150 million from the company. During their trial in March 2004, they contended the board of directors authorized it as compensation. During jury deliberations, juror Ruth Jordan, while passing through the courtroom, appeared to make an ""okay"" sign on the table. She later denied she had intended that gesture, but the incident received much publicity (including a caricature in the Wall Street Journal), and the juror received threats after her name became public. Judge Michael Obus declared a mistrial on April 4, 2004. On June 17, 2005, after a retrial, Kozlowski and Swartz were convicted on all but one of the more than 30 counts against them. The verdicts carry potential jail terms of up to 25 years in state prison. Kozlowski himself was sentenced to no less than eight years and four months and no more than 25 years in prison. Swartz received the same sentence. Then in May 2007, New Hampshire Federal District Court Judge Paul Barbadoro approved a class action settlement whereby Tyco agreed to pay $2.92 billion (in conjunction with $225 million by Pricewaterhouse Coopers, their auditors) to a class of defrauded shareholders represented by Grant &amp; Eisenhofer P.A., Schiffrin, Barroway, Topaz &amp; Kessler, and Milberg Weiss &amp; Bershad. On January 17, 2014, Kozlowski was granted parole, from the Lincoln Correctional Facility in New York City.

Tyco Printed Circuit Group (TPCG) of Stamford, Connecticut, was sentenced on 12 counts of violating the Clean Water Act in August 2004. The plea agreement called for TPCG to pay a total of $10 million in fines. Of that amount, $6 million was paid as a federal criminal fine; $2.7 million went to the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) natural resources fund; the Towns of Stafford and Manchester received $500,000 each to fund improvements in their sewer and water treatment system; and $300,000 was paid for recycling deionized and other wastewater at the company's Stafford, Staffordville facilities. Between 1999 and June 2001, TPCG managers at the company's Stafford, Staffordville and Manchester facilities engaged in a variety of practices that caused the facilities to discharge wastewater with higher than permitted levels of pollutants into municipal sewage treatment systems. The illegal practices included, but were not limited to, diluting potentially non-compliant wastewater samples, discarding samples with excessive levels of toxic metals, and omitting samples that were not in compliance for pH. Daniel R. Callahan, the former Director of Environmental Health and Safety of Stafford Division of Tyco Printed Circuit Group, pled guilty to violating the Clean Water Act on November 17, 2003. Callahan falsified reports submitted to the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The reports failed to include the fact that a ""batch tank"" had been discharged into the Manchester public sewer system. Tyco's DEP permit required that all discharges into public sewer systems be reported. Tyco was 41st on the 2002 Political Economy Research Institute's (PERI) Toxic 100."

(July 2014) Union Pacific Railroad System map (trackage rights in purple) Reporting mark UP, UPRR, UPY Locale United States from Chicago, Illinois, and cities along the Mississippi River to the Pacific coast Dates of operation 1862–present Track gauge 4&#160;ft&#160;8&#160;1⁄2&#160;in (1,435&#160;mm) standard gauge Length 32,100 miles (51,660&#160;km) Headquarters 1400 Douglas Street Omaha, Nebraska Website www.up.com The Union Pacific Railroad (reporting mark UP) is a Class I line haul freight railroad that operates 8,500 locomotives over 32,100 route-miles in 23 states west of Chicago, Illinois and New Orleans, Louisiana. The Union Pacific Railroad network is the largest in the United States and employs 42,600 people. It is also one of the world's largest transportation companies. Union Pacific Railroad is the principal operating company of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:&#160;UNP); both are headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. Over the years Union Pacific Corporation has grown by acquiring other railroads, notably the Missouri Pacific, Chicago &amp; North Western, Western Pacific, Missouri-Kansas-Texas, and the Southern Pacific (including the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western). Union Pacific Corporation's main competitor is the BNSF Railway, the nation's second largest freight railroad, which also primarily services the Continental U.S. west of the Mississippi River. Together, the two railroads have a duopoly on all transcontinental freight rail lines in the U.S. The current chairman of Union Pacific Corporation is Lance Fritz. The two lines were joined together at Promontory Summit, Utah, 53 miles (85&#160;km) west of Ogden on May 10, 1869, hence creating the first transcontinental railroad in North America. Under the guidance of its dominant stockholder Dr. Thomas Clark Durant, the namesake of the city of Durant, Iowa, the first rails were laid in Omaha. Subsequently, UP purchased three Mormon-built roads: the Utah Central Railroad extending south from Ogden to Salt Lake City, the Utah Southern Railroad extending south from Salt Lake City into the Utah Valley, and the Utah Northern Railroad extending north from Ogden into Idaho. It built or purchased local lines that gave it access to Denver, Colorado, to Portland, Oregon, and to the Pacific Northwest and acquired the Kansas Pacific (originally called the Union Pacific, Eastern Division, though in essence a separate railroad). It also owned narrow gauge trackage into the heart of the Colorado Rockies and a standard gauge line south from Denver across New Mexico into Texas (both parts of the Union Pacific, Denver and Gulf Railway). The Last Spike, by Thomas Hill, (1881) Directors of the Union Pacific Railroad gather on the 100th meridian, which later became Cozad, Nebraska, approximately 250 miles (400&#160;km) west of Omaha, Nebraska Territory, in October 1866. The train in the background awaits the party of Eastern capitalists, newspapermen, and other prominent figures invited by the railroad executives. UP was entangled in the Crédit Mobilier scandal, exposed in 1872. Its independent construction company the Crédit Mobilier had bribed congressmen. The UP itself was not guilty but it did get bad publicity. The financial crisis of 1873 led to financial troubles but not bankruptcy. The company was reorganized as the Union Pacific Railway on January 24, 1880, with its dominant stockholder being Jay Gould. The new company declared bankruptcy during the Panic of 1893. When it emerged in 1897 it reverted to the original name, Union Pacific Railroad.

UP's basic paint scheme for its diesel-electric locomotives is the oldest still in use by a major railroad. The middle two-thirds of the locomotive body is painted Armour Yellow, so-named because it was the color used by the Armour meat company. A thin band of Signal Red divides this from the Harbor Mist Gray (a fairly light gray) used for the body and roof above that point. Signal Red is also painted at the bottom of the locomotive body, but this color has gradually become yellow as new Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) regulations for reflectorized tape came into effect in 2005; the trucks, underframe, fuel tanks and everything else beneath that line are also Harbor Mist Gray. Lettering and numbering are in Signal Red, with black outlines. Some locomotives (historically passenger locomotives, and some recent units from 2000 on) have white-outlined blue ""wings"" on the nose. More recently, some units have been repainted with a large, billowing American flag with the corporate motto ""Building America"" on the side, where the 'UNION PACIFIC' lettering is normally positioned. This paint scheme is known as ""Building America,"" ""Wings,"" or ""Flags and Flares."" Union Pacific #5391, approaching bridge at Multnomah Falls Oregon, shows the white-outlined blue ""wings"" on the nose The Armour Yellow livery was first introduced on the UP's M-10000 streamliner train in 1934, although Leaf Brown was used instead of Harbor Mist Grey. Passenger cars, cabooses, and other non-freight equipment have also been painted in a similar fashion. The steam locomotive paint schemes are unique in their own way. Up until the mid-1940s, all steam locomotives on UP were painted in a standard scheme: the smokebox and firebox were painted graphite and the rest was painted jet black; the lettering was usually aluminum. In the late 1940s, many passenger steam locomotives were repainted in a two-tone grey scheme to match the scheme applied to some coaching stock. These locomotives were painted light grey, with one dark gray strip running from front to rear alongside the running board and in the middle of the tender. This dark grey strip was outlined in yellow (originally aluminum), and all lettering inside the strip was yellow also. After 1952, these locomotives were repainted in the same basic black color scheme as the earlier freight locomotives. The grey passenger cars were repainted in the yellow scheme. UP Locomotive GE AC4400CW 5645 in Battle Creek, Michigan, with the Flags and Flares paint scheme From the second half of 2005 to the summer of 2006, UP unveiled a new set of six EMD SD70ACe locomotives in ""Heritage Colors,"" painted in schemes reminiscent of railroads acquired by UP since the 1980s. The engine numbers match the year that the predecessor railroad was absorbed into Union Pacific. The locomotives commemorate the Missouri Pacific with UP 1982, the Western Pacific with UP 1983, the Missouri-Kansas-Texas with UP 1988, the Chicago and North Western with UP 1995, the Southern Pacific with UP 1996, and the Denver and Rio Grande Western with UP 1989. Although the Denver and Rio Grande Western was not a direct predecessor because it had purchased the SP in 1988 but kept the larger system's name, the Union Pacific still included it in the heritage series. A former Southern Pacific GP38-2 locomotive renumbered with UP ""patch"" markings As of May 23, 2015, UP operates 9 Southern Pacific (107,177,187, 266, 309, 319, 335, 343, and 352) 2 St. Louis Southwestern (9642, and 9708), and 2 Chicago and North Western (8646 and 8701) locomotives that are still in the former railroads' paint. In addition, many locomotives have been ""patched"" and renumbered by UP, varying in the degree of the previous railroads' logos being eradicated, but always with a yellow patch applied over the locomotive's former number and a new UP number applied on the cab. This allows UP to number locomotives into its roster, yet it takes less time and money than it does to perform a complete repaint into UP colors. As of May 17, 2015, UP rostered 212 ""patches"", consisting of: 22 Chicago and North Western (whose CNW logos have been hidden by the ""patches""), 174 Southern Pacific (AC4400CW, GP40-2, MP15AC, and GP60) 14 St. Louis Southwestern (GP60) 2 Denver and Rio Grande Western (GP60) While not technically a predecessor locomotive in the traditional sense, UP rosters a single SD40-2 (3564) still in the 1970s paint scheme. Also, several patched units have uniquenesses, such as UP 6289 (The 'flaming' patch), and UP 6361 (SP paint, with full UP letters on conductor's side). UP also rosters an ex-CNW AC4400CW in UP paint, that has been decaled with 'We Will Deliver' and Operation Lifesaver (6736). UP retains many CNW units with OLS decals. Historic locomotives UP 844 is a 4-8-4 Northern type express passenger steam locomotive (class FEF-3). It was the last steam locomotive built for UP and has been in continuous service since its 1944 delivery. Many people know the engine as the No. 8444, since an extra '4' was added to its number in 1962 to distinguish it from a diesel numbered in the 800 series. It regained its rightful number in June 1989, after the diesel was retired. A mechanical failure occurred on June 24, 1999, in which the boiler tubes from the 1996 overhaul, being made of the wrong material, collapsed inside the boiler and put the steam locomotive out of commission. The UP steam crew successfully repaired it and returned it to service on November 10, 2004. It is currently going under a 15-year inspection and should return to service by 2016. It is the only steam locomotive to never be officially retired from a North American Class I railroad. UP 3985 is a 4-6-6-4 Challenger class dual-service steam locomotive. It is the largest steam locomotive still in operation anywhere in the world. Withdrawn from service in 1962, it was stored in the UP roundhouse until 1975, when it was moved to the employees' parking lot outside the Cheyenne, Wyoming, depot until 1981 when a team of employee volunteers restored it to service. In 2007, it underwent repairs for service, and was back up and running in 2008 to continue its run. UP 3985 has been in storage since 2010, but may return to service once 4014's restoration is completed. UP 951, 949 and 963B are a trio of streamlined General Motors Electro-Motive Division E9 passenger locomotives built in 1955. They are used to haul the UP business cars and for charter specials. While externally they are 1955 vintage locomotives, the original twin 1200&#160;hp 12-cylinder 567 series engines have been replaced with single EMD 16-645E 2000&#160;hp (1.5 MW) engines and the electrical and control equipment similarly upgraded, making them more modern locomotives under the skin. Some refer to the units as ""E38-2"" units, as the internal equipment was taken from wrecked GP38-2 locomotives. The set is made of two A units and one B unit. The B unit contains an HEP engine-generator set for powering passenger cars. The two A units were recently modified to eliminate the nose doors to increase safety in the event of collision. UP 6936 is an EMD DDA40X ""Centennial"" diesel-electric locomotive. These were the largest diesel locomotives ever built and were manufactured specifically for UP. UP 5511 is a 2-10-2 steam locomotive. This locomotive is very rarely ever heard of, because it was never donated for public display. This locomotive is reportedly in excellent condition. The only thing keeping it from being restored is that it would be limited to 40&#160;mph (64&#160;km/h) or lower due to its large cylinders and small drivers. As of August 2004, this locomotive is being offered for sale by UP. It is currently in storage at the roundhouse where 844 &amp; 3985 are repaired in Cheyenne, Wyoming UP 1243 is a 4-6-0 steam locomotive, and is the oldest locomotive owned by UP. Built in 1890 and retired in 1957, it was at first stored in Rawlins, Wyoming. It was cosmetically restored in 1990 for public display, and toured with 844 as part of the Idaho and Wyoming Centennial train, being moved on a flat car. It was moved to Omaha, Nebraska in November 1996 and put on display at the Western Heritage Museum. In addition there are a number of other locomotives kept in storage for possible future restoration. Rio Grande (DRGW) F9B 5763 is one of the units in storage, part of the Trio (A-B-B) of F9s that served on the Rio Grande in various Passenger Duty services (From the Denver Ski Train to the Zephyr Trains) until their retirement in 1996. Sister Units 5771 (F9A) and 5762 (F9B) were donated to the Colorado Railroad Museum. Chicago and North Western F7 No. 401, used for Chicago and North Western business trains, also was retained by UP. UP 838, a twin to 844, is stored in the Cheyenne roundhouse as a parts source, though as most of its usable parts have already been applied to 844, it is more likely to see use as a source of pattern parts for reproduction replacements. Reputedly, 838's boiler is in better condition than that of 844, due to 838 having not been in steam since retirement, compared to 844's relatively heavy use since 1960. Among the former tenants was Southern Pacific 1518 (the first production SD7 ex EMD demo 990), transferred to the Illinois Railway Museum after some time in storage in the UP shops. Preserved steam locomotives Wine label, Roma Wine Company, bottled for Union Pacific RR circa 1940s. Union Pacific operated through passenger service over its historic ""Overland Route"" between 1869 until May 1, 1971. The last passenger train operated by UP was the westbound City of Los Angeles. After May 1, 1971, Amtrak assumed operation of long-distance passenger operations in the United States. UP at various times operated the following named passenger trains: Butte Special (operated between Salt Lake City and Butte, Montana) Challenger (operated jointly with the Chicago and North Western Railway until October 1955, and thereafter the Milwaukee Road) City of Denver (operated jointly with the Chicago and North Western Railway until October 1955, and thereafter the Milwaukee Road) City of Las Vegas; later, the Las Vegas Holiday Special (1956–1967) City of Los Angeles (operated jointly with the Chicago and North Western Railway until October 1955, and thereafter the Milwaukee Road) City of Portland (operated jointly with the Chicago and North Western Railway until October 1955, and thereafter the Milwaukee Road) City of Salina (1934–1940) City of San Francisco (operated jointly with the Chicago and North Western Railway and the Southern Pacific Railroad; after October, 1955 the Milwaukee Road assumed operation of the Chicago-Omaha leg of the service) City of St. Louis Columbine (in service to Chicago and Denver, beginning in the 1920s) Forty-Niner (operated between Chicago and Oakland) Gold Coast (operated between Chicago and Oakland/Los Angeles) Idahoan (operated between Cheyenne and Portland) Los Angeles Limited (in service 1905) Overland Flyer; renamed the Overland Limited in 1890 (1887–1963) Pacific Limited (operated between Chicago and Ogden, Utah where it was split to serve Los Angeles and San Francisco, beginning in 1913. It was combined with the Portland Rose in 1947.) Pony Express (operated between Kansas City and Los Angeles 1926—1954) Portland Rose (in service between Chicago and Portland, beginning in the 1920s) San Francisco Overland (originally operated between Chicago and Oakland, later terminated only at St. Louis) Spokane (operated between Spokane and Portland) Utahn (operated between Cheyenne and Los Angeles) Yellowstone Special (operated between Pocatello, Idaho and West Yellowstone, Montana) UP mainly operates commuter trains for Metra on the Union Pacific Lines: Union Pacific/North Line, Union Pacific/Northwest Line, and Union Pacific/West Line. Many Amtrak routes currently utilize Union Pacific rails: Amtrak Cascades California Zephyr Capitol Corridor Cardinal Coast Starlight Hoosier State Lincoln Service Missouri River Runner Pacific Surfliner San Joaquin Sunset Limited Texas Eagle Deadly derailment in Macdona, Texas on June 28, 2004 On June 28, 2004, in the San Antonio suburb of Macdona, Texas, a UP train collided with an idle BNSF train resulting in the puncturing of a 90-ton tank car carrying liquified chlorine. As the chlorine vaporized, a toxic ""yellow cloud"" soon formed which killed three (the UP conductor and two residents nearby) and caused 43 hospitalizations. The costs of cleanup and property damaged during the incident exceeded $7 million. Various investigations of the Macdona incident have revealed several serious safety lapses on the part of the Union Pacific and its employees; specifically, Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) officials in 2004 reported that the Union Pacific had ""notable deficiencies"", including its employees not following the company's own safety rules. The railroad's San Antonio Service Unit (SASU) has had other derailments, William Butler Ogden (1862–1863) John Adams Dix (1863–1865) Oliver Ames, Jr. (1866–1871) Thomas Alexander Scott (1871–1872) Horace F.

Development The timing of the events was notable because Northwest's golden shares in Continental (that gave Northwest veto authority against any merger involving Continental) could be redeemed, freeing Continental to pursue a marriage with United. On April 27, 2008, Continental broke off merger negotiations with United and stated it was going to stand alone. On October 1, 2010, UAL Corporation (the parent company of United Airlines) completed its acquisition of Continental Airlines and changed its name to United Continental Holdings, Inc. Although the two airlines remained separated until the operational integration was completed, as of this day both airlines are corporately controlled by the same leadership. Both carriers achieved a single operating certificate from the FAA on November 30, 2011 which allowed both airlines to operate under the name ""United"". United Continental Holdings, Inc. The Company became the parent company of Continental Airlines, Inc. (""Continental"") upon the closing of a merger transaction (the ""Merger"") on October 1, 2010. As part of the Merger integration, on March 31, 2013, the Company merged its two operating subsidiaries, Continental and United Airlines, Inc. (""United Airlines""), with Continental continuing as the surviving corporation and as a whollyowned subsidiary of the Company. Upon the closing of this transaction on March 31, 2013, Continental's name was changed to ""United Airlines, Inc."" (""United""). A Continental Airlines Boeing 737-900ER series aircraft (N53442) was the first aircraft to be painted into the new livery for the combined company. United Continental Holdings also brings its larger airline services to smaller communities via its branding rights and ownership over the Continental Connection, Continental Express, and United Express trademarks. Continental Connection and Continental Express will be consolidated into the United Express marketing and branding as the merger integration moves forward. As of late 2010, George Gershwin's 1924 ""Rhapsody in Blue"" will remain as the new United's theme song, the song has since been featured on new safety videos on United and Continental aircraft. It was announced February 2011 that United would maintain its p.s., or premium service transcontinental aircraft and update the interiors.

In 1977, UnitedHealthCare Corporation was created to reorganize the company and become the parent company of Charter Med. UnitedHealthCare’s charter was to manage the newly created Physicians Health Plan of Minnesota, an early health management organization. Also in 2007 UnitedHealth Group acquired The Lewin Group is a policy research and consulting firm. In June 2009, Ingenix, a UHG subsidiary, acquired AIM Healthcare. AIM is a data mining and insurance claim auditing service in the US. In July 2009, UnitedHealth Group Inc. agreed to acquire Health Net Inc.'s (HNT) Northeast licensed subsidiaries for up to $570 million in payments spread out over a two-year period. In Nov 2011, UnitedHealth Group Inc. signed to acquire XLHealth Corporation. In Feb 2012, UnitedHealth Group Inc. completed the XLHealth acquisition. XLHealth Corporation is a sponsor of Medicare Advantage health plans with a primary focus on medicare recipients with special needs such as those with chronic illness and those eligible for Medicaid (“dual eligibles”).  In March 2015, it was announced that CatamaranRx will be acquired by OptumRx (A UnitedHealth Group company). Prior to January 2011 UnitedHealth Group had the following operating segments: ACME (aka: Uniprise) - Employer Sponsored Coverage.

OptumInsight - Health Data Analytics OptumRx - Pharmacy Benefit Manager (now includes most UHG membership) OptumHealth - Healthcare delivery services and support including OptumCare, home to the organizations acquired staff model and IPA model physician groups, and ancillary services (Behavioral Health and Substance Abuse, Dental, Vision, Transplant Management) In the United Kingdom In 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began investigating the conduct of UnitedHealth Group's management and directors, for backdating of stock options. Investigations were also begun by the Internal Revenue Service and prosecutors in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York, who subpoenaed documents from the company. The investigations came to light after a series of probing stories in the Wall Street Journal in May 2006, discussing apparent backdating of hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock options by UHC management. The backdating apparently occurred with the knowledge and approval of the directors, according to the Journal. Major shareholders have filed lawsuits accusing former New Jersey governor Thomas Kean and UHC's other directors of failing in their fiduciary duty. In June 2006, the American Chiropractic Association filed a national class action lawsuit against the American Chiropractic Network (ACN), which is owned by UnitedHealth Group and administers chiropractic benefits, and against UnitedHealth Group itself, for alleged practices in violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). ^ a b c d e f ""UnitedHealth Group Inc 2015 Annual Report Form (10-K)"" (XBRL).

Casey and Ryan merged with a competitor, Evert McCabe, and formed Merchants Parcel Delivery. Consolidated delivery was also introduced, combining packages addressed to a certain neighborhood onto one delivery vehicle. UPS logo (1937-1961) In 1930, a consolidated service began in New York City, and soon after in other major cities in the East and the Midwest. In 1937, the logo was redesigned to reflect the company's new name United Parcel Service. In 1975, UPS moved its headquarters to Greenwich, Connecticut and began servicing all of the 48 contiguous states of the USA. UPS also established Canadian operations in 1975. On Feb. 28, UPS Ltd. (later changed to UPS Canada Ltd.) began operations in Toronto, Ontario. UPS Canada's head office is located in Burlington, Ontario. In 1976, UPS established a domestic operation in West Germany. In 2004, UPS entered the heavy freight business with purchase of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, a former subsidiary of Menlo Worldwide. UPS rebranded it as UPS Supply Chain Solutions. The purchase price was US$150&#160;million and the assumption of US$110&#160;million in long-term debt. On August 5, 2005, UPS announced that it has completed its acquisition of less-than-truckload (LTL) trucking company Overnite Transportation for US$1.25&#160;billion. This was approved by the FTC and Overnite shareholders on August 4, 2005. On April 28, 2006, Overnite officially became UPS Freight. On October 3, 2005, UPS completed the purchase of LYNX Express Ltd, one of the largest independent parcel carriers in the United Kingdom, for £55.5&#160;million (US$97.1&#160;million) after receiving approval for the transaction from the European Commission. The first joint package car center operation, in Dartford, Kent, is opened in 2006. On August 28, 2007, United Parcel Service celebrated its 100th anniversary. In June 2009, United Parcel Service lobbied to have language added to the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act. FedEx ran a negative ad campaign called Brown Bailout. On March 19, 2012, UPS announced that it intended to acquire TNT Express for $6.8 billion, in a move to help expand its presence in European and Asian markets. During Christmas 2013, UPS (as well as FedEx) failed to meet guaranteed Christmas delivery deadlines for a small percentage of customers. UPS's primary business is the time-definite delivery of packages and documents worldwide. In recent years, UPS has extended its service portfolio to include less than truckload transportation (primarily in the U.S.) and supply chain services. UPS reports its operations in three segments: U.S. Domestic Package operations, International Package operations, and Supply Chain &amp; Freight operations. U.S. Domestic Package UPS has service worldwide, including Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport (pictured above). International Package operations include delivery to more than 220 countries and territories worldwide, Supply Chain &amp; Freight (UPS-SCS for UPS Supply Chain Solutions) includes UPS' forwarding and contract logistics operations, UPS Freight, and other related business units. UPS' forwarding and logistics business provides services in more than 175 countries and territories worldwide, and includes worldwide supply chain design, execution and management, freight forwarding and distribution, customs brokerage, mail and consulting services. UPS Freight offers a variety of less than truckload (""LTL"") and truckload (""TL"") services to customers in North America. Other business units within this segment include The UPS Store and UPS Capital. Major competitors in the United States include United States Postal Service (USPS) and FedEx, as well as regional US carriers such as OnTrac, Eastern Connection, and Lone Star Overnight. In addition to these domestic carriers, UPS competes with a variety of international operators, including Canada Post, Purolator, TransForce, DHL Express, Deutsche Post (and its subsidiary DHL), Royal Mail, Japan Post, India Post and many other regional carriers, national postal services and air cargo handlers (see Package delivery and Mail pages). Historically, the bulk of UPS' competition came from inexpensive ground-based delivery services, such as Parcel Post (USPS) or Choice Logistics. But in 1998 FedEx expanded into the ground parcel delivery market by acquiring RPS (originally Roadway Package System) and rebranding it as FedEx Ground in 2000. In 2003 DHL expanded its US operations by acquiring Airborne Express, significantly increasing its presence in the United States, and adding more competition in the ground delivery market. In response to this, UPS partnered with the US Postal Service to offer UPS Mail Innovations, a program that allows UPS to pick up mail &amp; packages separately from the main Ground network and transfer them to a USPS center, or destination delivery unit (DDU), More recently, the continued growth of online shopping, combined with increasing awareness of the role transportation (including package delivery) has on the environment, has contributed to the rise of emerging competition from niche carriers or rebranded incumbents. For instance, the US Postal Service claims ""greener delivery"" of parcels on the assumption that USPS letter carriers deliver to each US address, six days a week anyway, and therefore offer the industry's lowest fuel consumption per delivery. Other carriers, like ParcelPool.com, United Parcel Service logo (1961–2003) designed by Paul Rand Vehicles UPS package car from rear quarter. US variant, Corpus Christi, Texas Mercedes Sprinter-based package car in London. The van carries the logo of the London 2012 Olympics, to show that UPS is a sponsor of the games A UPS trailer parked in Durham, North Carolina The UPS package car (or van) is a major symbol of the U.S. business world, with its iconic status referenced in an early-2000s ad campaign following UPS' sponsorship of Dale Jarrett in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series: the ads were about how the company would prefer to race the truck over a stock car despite the futility of doing so, as ""people love the truck"". The classic UPS package car is built on a General Motors or Ford chassis, has a manual transmission, manual steering, and no radio or air conditioning. Older vehicles are easily recognizable due to their round headlights and turn signals set onto a sculpted fiberglass hood. These are either Morgan Olson or Union City Body P-500, P-600, or P-800 step vans (a recent redesign changed the look, replacing the round turn signals with ovoid LED ones). The cars lack manufacturer's name or badges. Newer package cars in North America have either a Freightliner Trucks or Navistar International chassis; automatic transmissions and power steering are slowly appearing in package cars. UPS also operates Mercedes-Benz Sprinter box vans (occasionally with Dodge badges) as well as Dodge Grand Caravan minivans. When UPS ground vehicles reach the end of their useful service life and are no longer roadworthy (typically 20–25 years or more, but generally when the body's structural integrity is compromised), they are almost always stripped of reusable parts, repainted in household paint to cover up the trademark, and then sent to the scrapyard to be crushed and broken up. The only exception to this policy is when a package car is repainted white for internal use, usually at a large hub. Prior to scrapping, UPS trucks and trailers are assigned an ADA (Automotive Destruction Authorization) number and must be crushed under supervision of UPS Automotive personnel, which records the vehicle's destruction, as UPS does not re-sell any of its ground vehicles. Other trucks UPS commonly refers to its tractor-trailers as ""feeders"". The tractor units are painted the same Pullman brown as the package cars, while all company-owned trailers are painted gray. UPS trailers come in a variety of lengths. The shortest trailers (also known as ""Pups"") are 28 feet (8.5&#160;m) long; longer trailers (also known as ""Rails"") come in lengths of 45, 48 or 53 feet (16&#160;m). Towing two of the short trailers in tandem are referred to as ""double pups"" or a ""set."" There are three different types of feeders&#160;— Flatbed, Drop Frame, and Trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC); the latter are put onto railroad cars. Tractor units are usually made by Navistar or Mack, but a few Ford, Sterling, and Freightliner tractors are in the fleet. Past makes in the fleet include Chevrolet, GMC, and Diamond REO. At one time, UPS used electric-powered trucks, made by White Motors, for deliveries in Manhattan, NYC. There were only a few hundred of them, but they were notable for their ""spooky silence"" when running. Bicycles This section requires expansion. (July 2014) UPS offers 27 different services for their U.S., International, and Freight divisions. Services include: Next Day Air, Second Day Air, Three Day Select, Ground, Standard, and more. Other codes This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (September 2012) The UPS Parcel Network is based on a hub and spoke model. UPS operates centers that feed parcels to hubs where parcels are sorted and forwarded to their destinations. Centers typically are the point of entry for parcels and send the parcels to one or more hubs. A hub is a location where many centers send packages to be sorted and sent back out to other centers or hubs. For example, a standard ground parcel being shipped from Wilmington, North Carolina to San Francisco is picked up by a driver and taken to the Wilmington Package Center, where it is loaded on a trailer and driven to Greensboro, North Carolina. At Greensboro it would be loaded onto a trailer and sent by rail (trailer-on-flatcar in most cases) to the Oakland, California Hub. There it would then be forwarded to the delivery center in San Francisco, California, loaded onto the delivery vehicle, and transported to its final destination. The UPS air network runs similarly to the ground network through a hub-and-spoke system, though air hubs are typically located at airports so airplanes can quickly be unloaded, the packages sorted, and the aircraft loaded again. Centers feed packages to facilities at airports (called gateways), which in turn send them to an air hub to be sorted and put on another airplane to a final destination gateway, and then from there to a center. For instance, a Next Day Air package traveling from Seattle, Washington to Atlanta, Georgia, would be loaded onto an air container at Boeing Field just south of Seattle and flown to the Worldport (UPS air hub) in Louisville, Kentucky. From there it would be sorted to a container heading to Atlanta to Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, and taken by truck from the airport to the delivery center. The UPS Store pricing for non-UPS products Although The UPS Store provides UPS shipping at regular UPS rates, The UPS Store has been sometimes criticized for providing United States Postal Service (USPS) services at prices higher than consumers would have paid for the same services directly from the postal service. The UPS Store allows individuals to ship via USPS at varying rates that are not the retail rates the post office charges; this is viewed as more of a convenience fee (akin to paying a slightly higher price for groceries at a convenience store). USPS rules allow third-party stores to charge extra costs that they deem necessary. Fuel economy the fuel savings are considerable. In 2005, UPS eliminated 464,000 miles (747,000&#160;km) from its travel and saved 51,000 US gallons (190,000&#160;l) of fuel."

He pursued a strategy of growth and diversification, changing the parent corporation's name to United Technologies Corporation (UTC) in 1975 to reflect the intent to diversify into numerous high tech fields beyond aerospace. (The change became official on May 1, 1975.) The diversification was partially to balance civilian business against any overreliance on military business. UTC became a mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A)–focused organization, with various forced takeovers of unwilling smaller corporations. The next year (1976), UTC forcibly acquired Otis Elevator. Although M&amp;A activity was not new to United Aircraft, the M&amp;A activity of the 1970s and 1980s was higher-stakes and arguably unfocused. Rather than aviation being the central theme of UTC businesses, high tech (of any type) was the new theme.

At the time, it was the largest corporate spinoff in U.S. history. Valero took over the natural gas operations of the LoVaca Gathering Company, a defunct subsidiary of Coastal States Gas. The name Valero comes from Misión San Antonio de Valero. Valero acquired a small oil refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas in 1981, and began refining operations in 1984. In 1997, Valero spun off its refinery and retail divisions into a separate company, which kept the Valero name. At the same time, the remaining divisions, which consisted primarily of natural gas operations, were acquired by the Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Later that year, the firm acquired Basis Petroleum, which left it with four refineries in Texas and Louisiana. In 1998, it then acquired a Paulsboro, New Jersey, refinery, the company's first outside of the Gulf Coast area. In 2000, Valero purchased ExxonMobil's Benicia, California, refinery and interest in 350 Exxon-branded service stations in California, mainly in the San Francisco Bay Area. The company also began retailing gasoline under the Valero brand. In June 2001, Valero acquired the Huntway Refining Company, along with two asphalt plants on the West Coast. Shamrock gas station, a division of Valero EC On December 31, 2001, Valero completed its acquisition of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock. The merger left Valero with over 4,700 Ultramar, Diamond Shamrock, and Beacon retail sites in the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. With this acquisition, Valero also received ownership of Shamrock Logistics L.P., which was renamed Valero L.P. In 2006, the division was spun off as NuStar Energy. Starting in 2002, Valero has expanded its marketing to the East Coast, specifically the Northeast and Florida, using the Valero brand. The acquisition also includes all past Diamond Shamrock assets, including the former Sigmor Petroleum assets founded by Thomas E. Turner, founder of TETCO Inc. (the Sigmor brand name was the initials of Sigfried Moore, Turner's former employer) which merged with Shamrock Oil and Gas in 1960 forming Sigmor Shamrock - which was merged into Diamond Shamrock in 1982. Turner later repurchased Mission Petroleum Carriers when it was acquired by Diamond Shamrock which was the foundation of TETCO, The Political Economy Research Institute ranks Valero 28th among corporations that emit airborne pollutants in the United States. The ranking is based on both the quantity (3.4 million pounds in 2005) and the toxicity of the emissions. is located 23 miles (37&#160;km) south from downtown Los Angeles. author and managing editor of Energy Tribune, Valero Energy Corp. has been awarded multiple multimillion-dollar contracts by the U.S. Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) in order to provide fuel to Israel. Divestitures On August 1, 2011, Valero acquired the Pembroke Refinery from Chevron, as well as the marketing and logistics assets, for $730 million, excluding working capital, which was valued at approximately $1 billion. The Pembroke plant is one of the largest and most complex refineries in Western Europe with a total throughput capacity of 270,000 barrels (43,000&#160;m3) per day and a Nelson complexity index rating of 11.8. This puts Valero at a total of 15 refineries and 2.9 million barrels (460,000&#160;m3) per day of throughput capacity overall, solidifying the company’s standing as the world’s largest independent refinery. Valero also purchased ownership interest in four major pipelines and eleven fuel terminals, a 14,000-barrel (2,200&#160;m3)-per-day aviation fuel business, and a network of more than 1,000 Texaco-branded wholesale sites, which is the largest branded dealer network in the United Kingdom and the second-largest in Ireland. Valero has continued with the Texaco brand in these markets. Retail Valero attempted to shift its focus from being a discount gasoline brand to becoming a premium brand. As part of the shift, Valero began to rebrand its Ultramar, Beacon, Total, and Diamond Shamrock stations to the Valero brand. The Beacon and Shamrock brands are used by retailers as a low-cost alternative to the premium Valero brand. The Shamrock brand is based on the former Shamrock Oil and Gas Company, which merged with Diamond Alkali in 1967 to form Diamond Shamrock, thus declaring the trademark from official abandonment. The name Ultramar, while being eliminated in the United States, continued as Valero's brand name in Canada. Valero introduced its updated ""Corner Store"" retail concept on December 28, 2007, opening the company's first 5,500-square-foot (510&#160;m2) prototype in western San Antonio. The Corner Store retail division, originally part of Diamond Shamrock, was absorbed into Valero's business portfolio in 2001. Not all Valero gas stations included a Corner Store - one Valero gas station in Euless, Texas east of Fort Worth is co-branded with a 7-Eleven convenience store. Creation of CST Brands"

Verisign_Inc.," Verisign, Inc. Type Public Traded&#160;as NASDAQ:&#160;VRSN S&amp;P 500 Component Founded 1995; 21&#160;years ago&#160;(1995) Headquarters Reston, Virginia, United States Key&#160;people Founder and CEO: James Bidzos Industry Internet, Communications Revenue US$ 965.087&#160;million (2013)  US$ 873.592&#160;million (2012)  Operating income US$ 528.232&#160;million (2013)  US$ 457.327&#160;million (2012)  Net income US$ 544.45&#160;million (2013)  US$ 320.032&#160;million (2012)  Total assets US$ 2,660.767&#160;million (2013)  US$ 2,062.476&#160;million (2012)  Total equity US$ -423.558&#160;million (2013)  US$ -9.323&#160;million (2012)  Slogan(s) Powered by Verisign Website www.verisign.com Alexa rank 20,539 (November 2015) Verisign, Inc. is an American company based in Reston, Virginia, United States that operates a diverse array of network infrastructure, including two of the Internet's thirteen root nameservers, the authoritative registry for the .com, .net, and .name generic top-level domains and the .cc and .tv country-code top-level domains, and the back-end systems for the .jobs, .gov, and .edu top-level domains. Verisign also offers a range of security services, including managed DNS, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack mitigation and cyber-threat reporting. In 2010, Verisign sold its authentication business unit – which included SSL certificate, PKI, Verisign Trust Seal, and Verisign Identity Protection (VIP) services – to Symantec for $1.28 billion. Verisign was founded in 1995 as a spin-off of the RSA Security certification services business. The new company received licenses to key cryptographic patents held by RSA and a time limited non-compete agreement. The new company served as a certificate authority (CA) and its initial mission was ""providing trust for the Internet and Electronic Commerce through our Digital Authentication services and products"". Prior to selling its certificate business to Symantec in 2010, Verisign had more than 3 million certificates in operation for everything from military to financial services and retail applications, making it the largest CA in the world. In 2000, Verisign acquired Network Solutions, which operated the .com, .net and .org TLDs under agreements with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the United States Department of Commerce. Those core registry functions formed the basis for Verisign’s naming division, which is now the company’s largest and most significant business unit. Verisign divested the Network Solutions retail (domain name registrar) business in 2003, retaining the domain name registry (wholesale) function as its core Internet addressing business. Verisign operates two businesses, Naming Services, which encompasses the operation of top-level domains and critical Internet infrastructure, and Network Intelligence and Availability (NIA) Services, which encompasses DDoS mitigation, managed DNS and threat intelligence. Verisign's share price tumbled in early 2014, hastened by the U.S. government's announcement that it would ""relinquish oversight of the Internet's domain-naming system to a non-government entity"". Security token produced by Verisign On August 9, 2010, Symantec completed its approximately $1.28 billion acquisition of Verisign's authentication business, including the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Certificate Services, the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Services, the Verisign Trust Services, the Verisign Identity Protection (VIP) Authentication Service, and the majority stake in Verisign Japan. This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (August 2013) Verisign's core business is its naming services division. The division operates the authoritative domain name registries for two of the Internet's most important top-level domains, .com and .net. It is also the contracted registry operator for the .name and .gov top-level domains as well as the country code top-level domains .cc (Cocos Islands) and .tv (Tuvalu). In addition, Verisign is the primary technical subcontractor for the .edu, and .jobs top-level domains for their respective registry operators which are non-profit organizations; in this role Verisign maintains the zone files for these particular domains and host the domains from their domain servers. Registry operators are the ""wholesalers"" of Internet domain names, while domain name registrars act as the “retailers”, working directly with consumers to register a domain name address. Verisign also operates two of the Internet’s thirteen ""root servers"" which are identified by the letters A-M (Verisign operates the “A” and “J” root servers). The root servers form the top of the hierarchical Domain Name System that supports all Internet communication. Verisign also generates the globally recognized root zone file and is also responsible for processing changes to that file once they are ordered by ICANN and approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Changes to the root zone were originally distributed via the A root server, but now they are distributed to all thirteen servers via a separate distribution system which Verisign maintains. Verisign is the only one of the 12 root server operators to operate more than one of the thirteen root nameservers. The A and J root servers are ""anycasted” and are no longer operated from any of the company's own datacenters as a means to increase redundancy and availability and mitigate the threat of a single point of failure. VeriSign's naming services division dates back to 1993 when Network Solutions was awarded a contract by the National Science Foundation to manage and operate the civilian side of the Internet's domain name registrations. This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (August 2013) Following the sale of its authentication services division in 2010, Verisign relocated from its former headquarters in Mountain View, California, to the headquarters of the naming division in Sterling, Virginia (originally NSI Registry's headquarters). Verisign began shopping that year for a new permanent home shortly after moving. They signed a lease for 12061 Bluemont Way in Reston, the former Sallie Mae headquarters, in 2010 and decided to purchase the building in September 2011. They have since terminated their lease of their current space in two buildings at Lakeside@Loudoun Technology Center. The company completed its move at the end of November 2011. The new headquarters is located in the Reston Town Center development which has become a major commercial and business hub for the region. In addition to its Reston headquarters, Verisign owns three data center properties. One at 22340 Dresden Street in Dulles, Virginia not far from its corporate headquarters (within the large Broad Run Technology Park), one at 21 Boulden Circle in New Castle, Delaware, and a third in Fribourg, Switzerland. Their three data centers are mirrored so that a disaster at one data center has a minimal impact on operations. Verisign also leases an office suite in downtown Washington, D.C., on K street where its government relations office is located. It also has leased server space in numerous internet data centers around the world where the DNS constellation resolution sites are located, mostly at major internet peering facilities. One such facility is at the Equinix Ashburn Datacenter in Ashburn, Virginia, one of the world's largest datacenters and internet transit hubs. Controversies In February 2012 Verisign revealed that their network security had been repeatedly breached in 2010. Verisign stated that the breach did not impact the Domain Name System (DNS) that they maintain, but would not provide details about the loss of data. Verisign was widely criticized for not disclosing the breach earlier and apparently attempting to hide the news in an October 2011 SEC filing. On November 29, 2010, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (U.S. ICE) issued seizure orders against 82 web sites with .com Internet addresses that were reported to be involved in the illegal sale and distribution of counterfeit goods. ^ a b c d e f g h ""VERISIGN INC/CA 2013 Q4 Quarterly Report Form (10-K)"" (XBRL).

Stephenson (President and Chief Executive Officer) Revenue US$1.7 billion (2014) Net income US$803 million (2014) The firm did not raise any funds for itself in the IPO, which was designed to provide an opportunity for the firm's casualty and property insurer owners to sell some or all of their holdings and to provide a market price for those retaining their shares. The 2009 IPO was priced at $22 per share for 85.25 million shares owned by its shareholders, including American International Group, The Hartford and Travelers, making it the largest since the 2008 IPO for Visa Inc. Among the firm's largest shareholders, Berkshire Hathaway was the only company not to sell any of its stock in the October IPO.

(&#160;listen&#160;(help·info)) (/vəˈraɪzən/ və-RY-zən), is an American broadband and telecommunications company, the largest U.S. wireless communications service provider as of September 2014, Bell Atlantic came into existence in 1984 with a footprint from New Jersey to Virginia, with each area having a separate operating company (consisting of New Jersey Bell, Bell of Pennsylvania, Diamond State Telephone, and C&amp;P Telephone). As part of the rebranding that the Baby Bells took in the mid-1990s, all of the operating companies assumed the Bell Atlantic name. In 1997, Bell Atlantic expanded into New York and the New England states by merging with fellow Baby Bell NYNEX. In addition, Bell Atlantic moved their headquarters from Philadelphia into the old NYNEX headquarters and rebranded the entire company as Bell Atlantic. In 2000 Bell Atlantic merged with GTE, which operated telecommunications companies across most of the rest of the country that was not already in Bell Atlantic's footprint. Bell Atlantic, the surviving company, changed its name to ""Verizon"", a portmanteau of veritas (Latin for ""truth"") and horizon. As of 2016, Verizon is one of three companies that had their roots in the former Baby Bells. The other two, like Verizon, exist as a result of mergers among fellow former Baby Bell members. One, SBC Communications, bought out its former parent AT&amp;T Corporation and assumed the AT&amp;T name. The other, CenturyLink, was formed initially in 2011 by the acquisition of Qwest (formerly named US West).

Bell Atlantic's original roster of operating companies included: The Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania New Jersey Bell Diamond State Telephone C&amp;P Telephone (itself made of four subsidiaries) Bell Atlantic originally operated in the states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia, as well as Washington, DC. In 1994, Bell Atlantic became the first RBOC to entirely drop the original names of its original operating companies. In 1996, CEO and Chairman Raymond W. Smith orchestrated Bell Atlantic's merger with NYNEX. When it merged, it moved its corporate headquarters from Philadelphia to New York City. NYNEX was consolidated into this name by 1997. Formation (2000–2002) ), and created a backlog of repairs. MCI (WorldCom) acquisition Verizon began negotiations to purchase long distance carrier MCI in 2005. MCI accepted the company's initial $6.75 billion offer in February 2005, but then received a higher offer from Qwest Communications. Verizon increased its bid to $7.6 billion (or $23.50 a share), which MCI accepted on March 29, 2005. Protesters staged the National Day of Out(R)age due in part to the controversy. Selling wirelines (2005–2010 &amp; 2015) However, in its Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 24, 2012, Verizon reported having paid more than $11.1 billion in taxes (including income, employment and property taxes) from 2009 to 2011. In addition, the company reported in the 10-K that most of the drop in employment since 2008 was due to a voluntary retirement offer. In July 2012, the FCC required Verizon to stop charging users an added fee for using 4G smartphones and tablets as Wi-fi hotspots (known as ""tethering""). Verizon had been charging its customers, even those with ""unlimited"" plans, $20 per month for tethering. As part of the settlement, Verizon made a voluntary payment of $1.25 million to the U.S. Treasury. In August 2012, the Department of Justice approved Verizon's purchase of Advanced Wireless Services (AWS) spectrum from a consortium of cable companies, including Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, for $3.9 billion. On June 5, 2013, The Guardian reported it had obtained an order by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and approved by the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that required Verizon to provide the NSA with telephone metadata for all calls originating in the U.S. (see also MAINWAY article) In September 2013, Verizon purchased the 45% stake in Verizon Wireless owned by Vodafone for $130 billion. On February 28, 2013, Verizon launched the Verizon Partner Program (VPP), which offers medium-sized preferred access to its businesses' cloud, mobility, communications, and networking solutions. There are four levels to VPP membership: Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Member. Each offers a different level of benefits and requirements. VPP also offers three business models: Agent, Resale, and Sell With. Each represents a different relationship with Verizon. Some Partner Program companies include General Datatech, SOVA (a Platinum member in the program), and OEM Data Delivery.

Vertex_Pharmaceuticals," Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Type Corporation Traded&#160;as NASDAQ:&#160;VRTX Industry Pharmaceuticals &amp; Biotherapeutics) Revenue US$1.4 billion (2011) Website www.vrtx.com Vertex Pharmaceuticals is an American Pharmaceutical company based in Boston, Massachusetts. Vertex was founded in 1989 by Joshua Boger In May 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug telaprevir (Incivek), an oral treatment for hepatitis C marketed by Vertex. Development and commercialization of telaprevir is shared with Johnson &amp; Johnson for European distribution and Mitsubishi for Asia. Telaprevir is a protease inhibitor. In 2012 ivacaftor (trade name Kalydeco), was designated as an orphan drug, identifying cystic fibrosis as affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. On January 31, 2012, Vertex gained FDA approval ) for the most common mutation in CF, known as F508del, and expects the first set of results in 2012. Vertex worked for 13 years with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to develop the drug. In the UK, the company provided the drug free for a limited time for certain patients, then left the hospitals to decide whether to continue to pay for it for those patients. UK agencies estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) at between £335,000 and £1,274,000—far above the NICE thresholds of £20,000-£30,000. On November 5, 2014 Vertex announced the submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for a fully co-formulated combination of lumacaftor and ivacaftor for people with cystic fibrosis ages 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Twenty-nine physicians and scientists working with people with cystic fibrosis (CF) wrote to Jeff Leiden, CEO of Vertex Pharmaceuticals to plead for lower prices. ""We are aware of the financial complexities of the huge expenses for R &amp; D with respect to the small number of patients or the market system that enables these advances to become reality. Yet -- notwithstanding all your patient support programs -- it is at best unseemly for Vertex to charge our patients’ insurance plans (including strapped state medical assistance plans), $294,000 annually for two pills a day (a 10-fold increase in a typical patient's total drug costs). This action could appear to be leveraging pain and suffering into huge financial gain for speculators, some of whom were your top executives who reportedly made millions of dollars in a single day (Boston Globe, May 29)."" — David M. Orenstein, MD et al. The company responded in an email that ""while publicly funded academic research provided important early understanding of the cause of cystic fibrosis, it took Vertex scientists 14 years of their own research, funded mostly by the company, before the drug won approval."""

(short for Video &amp; Audio Communications) is an American global mass media company with interests primarily in cinema and cable television. It is the world's sixth largest broadcasting and cable company in terms of revenue (behind Comcast, The Walt Disney Company, Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc., Time Warner, and CBS Corporation, respectively). Voting control of Viacom is held by National Amusements, Inc., a privately owned theater company controlled by billionaire Sumner Redstone. Redstone also holds, via National Amusements, a controlling stake in CBS Corporation. The current Viacom was created on December 31, 2005, as a spin-off from CBS Corporation, which changed its name from Viacom to CBS at the same time. CBS, not Viacom, retains control of the over-the-air broadcasting, TV production, outdoor advertising, subscription pay television (Showtime) and publishing assets (Simon &amp; Schuster) previously owned by the pre-split company. Predecessor firms of Viacom include Gulf+Western, which later became Paramount Communications Inc., and Westinghouse Electric Corporation. Comprising BET Networks, Viacom Media Networks, and Paramount Pictures, Viacom operates approximately 170 networks reaching approximately 700&#160;million subscribers in 160 countries. Main article: Viacom (original) In March 2005, the prior Viacom announced plans of looking into splitting the company into two publicly traded companies because of a stagnating stock price and the rivalry between Leslie Moonves and Tom Freston, longtime heads of MTV Networks. In addition, the company was facing issues after MTV was banned from producing any more Super Bowl halftime shows after the Super Bowl Halftime Show controversy of 2004. After the departure of Mel Karmazin in 2004, Sumner Redstone, who served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, decided to split the offices of President and Chief Operating Officer between Moonves and Freston. Redstone was set to retire in the near future, and a split was seen as a creative solution to the matter of replacing him. It was also intended to provide alternative investments that would be more appealing to investors: one a high cash flow, lower growth company that could afford to pay a substantial dividend and the other a growing company that would have greater investment opportunities and therefore would not be expected to pay a dividend. A new company, the present Viacom, was created and was headed by Freston. It comprises BET Networks, MTV Networks, and Paramount Pictures Corporation. 2000s In June 2005, Viacom announced its purchase of Neopets, a virtual pet website, along with GameTrailers, GoCityKids, and IFILM. That December, Paramount announced it would acquire DreamWorks. All indications were that the whole of DreamWorks—both live-comedy film and TV studios, albeit not the DreamWorks archive (which was sold to a group led by George Soros in March 2006) nor the animated unit (which was not part of the deal)—would remain owned by Viacom, even though CBS acquired Paramount's own TV studio. On February 1, 2006, Paramount completed its long-awaited acquisition of DreamWorks. On April 24, Viacom obtained Xfire. In August, just hours before announcing its most recent quarterly earnings, Viacom announced that it had acquired Atom Entertainment for $200&#160;million. In September, Viacom acquired game developer Harmonix for $175&#160;million. In February 2007, Viacom ordered leaked copyrighted video clips be taken off the videosharing service YouTube for copyright reasons. At the end of the year, Time Warner Cable (along with partner Bright House Networks) and Viacom's MTV Networks could not come to terms for the renewal of any Viacom channel beyond the end of year. Later, in October 2011, Viacom purchased a majority stake in Bellator Fighting Championships. Spike TV plans to air Bellator in 2013, after the rights to the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) library ends in 2012. On July 10, 2012, during contract negotiations over raising carrier rates the U.S. satellite TV provider, DirecTV's executives approached Viacom with a new proposal and a request to continue broadcasting 17 of Viacom's television networks (including Nickelodeon, MTV, Logo, and Comedy Central) during talks, but received no response and thus Viacom ceased transmission to DirecTV's 20 million subscribers. On April 1, 2014, Cable One removed 15 channels owned by Viacom (MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, and TV Land) off after the two companies failed to reach an agreement. Channels were replaced with other networks, including BBC America, Sprout, SundanceTV, IFC, Investigation Discovery, TV One, CMP/TV, National Geographic Channel, and TheBlaze. The change has been deemed permanent. On May 1, 2014, Viacom announced it had agreed to take over the British broadcaster Channel 5 from Northern &amp; Shell, the media group owned by the British newspaper publisher Richard Desmond. Viacom becomes the first American media company to take over a British broadcaster with a public service remit. On March 13, 2007, Viacom filed a US$1&#160;billion legal claim (Viacom International Inc. v. YouTube, Inc.) against Google and YouTube alleging massive copyright infringement, alleging that users frequently uploaded copyrighted material to YouTube—enough to cause a hit in revenue for Viacom and a gain in advertisement revenue for YouTube. Writing for a two-judge panel (because Judge Roger Miner had died while the trial was pending) of the Second Circuit, Judge José A. Cabranes concluded that ""a reasonable jury could find that YouTube had actual knowledge or awareness of specific infringing activity on its website"". Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law, expressed concern that the ruling would negatively affect startups, by making them ""more hair-trigger on taking down news or content, for fear that failure to do so will be held against them by content providers"". Main article: Viacom International As with the old Viacom, the current company owns Viacom International, which is the formal owner of copyrights associated with Viacom's corporate website and its cable networks. This division now owns the rights to a majority of Elvis Presley films made for Paramount Pictures, such as Blue Hawaii and King Creole. It also continues to focus on its own in-house productions made for its various networks (MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, etc.). Corporate governance The previous board of directors of Viacom were George S. Abrams, David Andelman, Joseph Califano, Jr., William Cohen, Philippe Dauman, Alan C. Greenberg, Charles Phillips, Shari Redstone, Sumner Redstone, Frederic Salerno, William Schwartz, and Robert D. Walter. Following the Viacom/CBS split, the Viacom board consisted of George S. Abrams, Philippe Dauman, Thomas E. Dooley, Ellen V. Futter, Robert Kraft, Alan Greenberg, Charles Phillips, Sumner Redstone (Chairman), Shari Redstone (non-executive Vice-Chair), Frederic Salerno, and William Schwartz. As of 2010, the Board consists of George Abrams, Philippe Dauman, Thomas E. Dooley, Alan Greenberg, Robert Kraft, Blythe McGarvie, Charles Phillips, Shari E. Redstone, Sumner M.

(/ˈviːzə/ or /ˈviːsə/) is an American multinational financial services corporation headquartered in Foster City, California, United States. In 2009, Visa’s global network (known as VisaNet) processed 62&#160;billion transactions with a total volume of $4.4&#160;trillion. A 1976 ad promoting the change of name to ""Visa"". Note the early Visa card shown in the ad, as well as the image of the BankAmericard that it replaced. In mid-September 1958, Bank of America (BofA) launched its BankAmericard credit card program in Fresno, California, with an initial mass mailing (or ""drop"", as they came to be called) of 60,000 unsolicited credit cards. The original idea was the brainchild of BofA's in-house product development think tank, the Customer Services Research Group, and its leader, Joseph P. Williams. Williams convinced senior BofA executives in 1956 to let him pursue what became the world's first successful mass mailing of unsolicited credit cards (actual working cards, not mere applications) to a large population. Williams' pioneering accomplishment was that he brought about the successful implementation of the all-purpose credit card (in the sense that his project was not cancelled outright), not in coming up with the idea. The need for a unified financial instrument was already evident to the American financial services industry, but no one could figure out how to do it. There were already charge cards like Diners Club (which had to be paid in full at the end of each billing cycle), and ""by the mid-1950s, there had been at least a dozen attempts to create an all-purpose credit card."" Fresno was selected for its population of 250,000 (big enough to make a credit card work, small enough to control initial startup cost), BofA's market share of that population (45%), and relative isolation, to control public relations damage in case the project failed. However, the program was riddled with problems, as Williams (who had never worked in a bank's loan department) had been too earnest and trusting in his belief in the basic goodness of the bank's customers, and he resigned in December 1959. The original goal of BofA was to offer the BankAmericard product across California, but in 1966, BofA began to sign licensing agreements with a group of banks outside of California, in response to a new competitor, Master Charge (now MasterCard), which had been created by an alliance of several other California banks to compete against BankAmericard. BofA itself (like all other U.S. banks at the time) could not expand directly into other states due to federal restrictions not repealed until 1994. Over the following 11 years, various banks licensed the card system from Bank of America, thus forming a network of banks backing the BankAmericard system across the United States. In Canada, an alliance of banks (including Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, Banque Canadienne Nationale and Bank of Nova Scotia) issued credit cards under the Chargex name from 1968 to 1977. In France, it was known as Carte Bleue (Blue Card). The logo still appears on many French-issued Visa cards today. In Japan, The Sumitomo Bank issued BankAmericards through the Sumitomo Credit Service. In the UK, the only BankAmericard issuer for some years was Barclaycard. The branding still exists today, but is used not only on Visa cards issued by Barclays, but on its MasterCard and American Express cards as well. In 1968, a manager at the National Bank of Commerce (later Rainier Bancorp), Dee Hock, was asked to supervise that bank's launch of its own licensed version of BankAmericard in the Pacific Northwest market. Although Bank of America had cultivated the public image that BankAmericard's troubled startup issues were now safely in the past, Hock realized that the BankAmericard licensee program itself was in terrible disarray because it had developed and grown very rapidly in an ad hoc fashion. For example, ""interchange"" transaction issues between banks were becoming a very serious problem, which had not been seen before when Bank of America was the sole issuer of BankAmericards. Hock suggested to other licensees that they form a committee to investigate and analyze the various problems with the licensee program; they promptly made him the chair of that committee. In June 1970, Bank of America gave up control of the BankAmericard program. The various BankAmericard issuer banks took control of the program, creating National BankAmericard Inc. (NBI), an independent Delaware corporation which would be in charge of managing, promoting and developing the BankAmericard system within the United States. In other words, BankAmericard was transformed from a franchising system into a jointly controlled consortium or alliance, like its competitor Master Charge. Hock became NBI's first president and CEO. However, Bank of America retained the right to directly license BankAmericard to banks outside of the United States, and continued to issue and support such licenses. By 1972, licenses had been granted in 15 countries. In 1974, the International Bankcard Company (IBANCO), a multinational member corporation, was founded in order to manage the international BankAmericard program. Sample Barclaycard (left), as issued in the UK in the 1960s/70s. Co-branded cards were also issued by affiliates, such as the Co-operative Bank and Yorkshire Bank. The Chargex logo (right) used in Canada. In 1976, the directors of IBANCO determined that bringing the various international networks together into a single network with a single name internationally would be in the best interests of the corporation; however, in many countries, there was still great reluctance to issue a card associated with Bank of America, even though the association was entirely nominal in nature. For this reason, in 1976, BankAmericard, Barclaycard, Carte Bleue, Chargex, Sumitomo Card, and all other licensees united under the new name, ""Visa"", which retained the distinctive blue, white and gold flag. NBI became Visa USA and IBANCO became Visa International. Prior to October 3, 2007, Visa comprised four non-stock, separately incorporated companies that employed 6,000 people worldwide: Visa International Service Association (Visa) – the worldwide parent entity, Visa U.S.A. Inc., Visa Canada Association, and Visa Europe Ltd. The latter three separately incorporated regions had the status of group members of Visa International Service Association. The unincorporated regions Visa Latin America (LAC), Visa Asia Pacific and Visa Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEMEA) were divisions within Visa. Billing &amp; finance charge methods The second step came on November 9, 2007, when the new Visa Inc. submitted its $10&#160;billion IPO filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The IPO took place on March 18, 2008. Visa sold 406&#160;million shares at US$44 per share ($2 above the high end of the expected $37–42 pricing range), raising US$17.9&#160;billion in the largest initial public offering in U.S. history. On March 20, 2008, the IPO underwriters (including JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., Banc of America Securities LLC, Citi, HSBC, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., UBS Investment Bank and Wachovia Securities) exercised their overallotment option, purchasing an additional 40.6&#160;million shares, bringing Visa's total IPO share count to 446.6&#160;million, and bringing the total proceeds to US$19.1&#160;billion. In July 2012, the Reykjavík District Court decided that Valitor (the Icelandic partner of Visa and MasterCard) was violating the law when it prevented donations to the site by credit card. It was ruled that the donations be allowed to return to the site within 14 days or they would be fined in the amount of US$6,000 per day. In October 2010, Visa and MasterCard reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department in another antitrust case. The companies agreed to allow merchants displaying their logos to decline certain types of cards (because interchange fees differ), or to offer consumers discounts for using cheaper cards. On March 26, 2008, the European Commission opened an investigation into Visa's multilateral interchange fees for cross-border transactions within the EEA as well as into the ""Honor All Cards"" rule (under which merchants are required to accept all valid Visa-branded cards). The antitrust authorities of EU Member States other than the United Kingdom are also investigating MasterCard's and Visa's interchange fees. For example, on January 4, 2007, the Polish Office of Competition and Consumer Protection fined twenty banks a total of PLN 164&#160;million (about $56&#160;million) for jointly setting MasterCard's and Visa's interchange fees. A senior official from the European Central Bank called for a break-up of the Visa/MasterCard duopoly by creation of a new European debit card for use in the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). The settlement provides for the cash equivalent of a 10 basis-point reduction (0.1 percent) of swipe fees charged to merchants for a period of eight months. This eight-month period would probably begin in the middle of 2013. The total value of the settlement will be about $7.25&#160;billion. Very high interchange fee for Visa (1.5–1.6% from every transaction's final price, which also includes VAT tax) in Poland started discussion about legality and need for government regulations of interchange fees to avoid high costs for business (which also block electronic payment market and acceptability of cards). This situation also led to the birth of new methods of payment, which avoid the need for go-between (middleman) companies like Visa or MasterCard, for example mobile application issued by major banks, Visa offers through its issuing members the following types of cards: Debit cards (pay from a checking / savings account) Credit cards (pay monthly payments with or with out interest depending on a customer paying on time.) Prepaid cards (pay from a cash account that has no checkwriting privileges) Visa operates the Plus automated teller machine network and the Interlink EFTPOS point-of-sale network, which facilitate the ""debit"" protocol used with debit cards and prepaid cards. They also provide commercial payment solutions for small businesses, midsize and large corporations, and governments. In ten U.S. states, surcharges for the use of a credit card are forbidden by law (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma and Texas) but a discount for cash is permitted under specific rules. as an additional security test. (On newer Visa cards, the UV dove is replaced by a small V over the Visa logo.) Beginning in 2005, the Visa standard was changed to allow for the hologram to be placed on the back of the card, or to be replaced with a holographic magnetic stripe (""HoloMag""). In 2007, Visa became sponsor of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. The FIFA partnership provides Visa with global rights to a broad range of FIFA activities - including both the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women's World Cup. Since 1995, Visa has sponsored the U.S. National Football League (NFL) and a number of NFL teams, including the San Francisco 49ers whose practice jerseys display the Visa logo."

The company was formed on December 31, 2014 after Walgreens purchased the 55% stake in Switzerland-based Alliance Boots that it did not already own. Walgreens had previously purchased 45% of the company in 2012 with an option to purchase the remaining shares within three years. Under the terms of the merger, the new company was organized into three divisions: Retail Pharmacy USA (Walgreens), Retail Pharmacy International (Boots), and Pharmaceutical Wholesale, incorporating Alliance Healthcare.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (March 2016) Boots forms the main part of the Retail Pharmacy International division of the company. The Boots brand has a history stretching back over 160 years and is a familiar sight on Britain's high streets. Stores are located in prominent high street and city center locations as well as in local communities. Most branches include a pharmacy and focus on healthcare, personal care and cosmetic products, with most stores selling over the counter medicines. Larger stores typically offer a variety of healthcare services in addition to dispensing prescriptions, and chlamydia testing &amp; treatment (private service). Optician services are also offered in many larger stores, with Boots Opticians providing eye tests along with the sale of spectacles and contact lenses. Many stores also feature traditional photo processing and/or a Kodak picture kiosk where users of digital cameras and camera phones can create prints. Larger stores usually offer a range of electrical equipment such as hairdryers, curlers and foot massagers, whilst selected stores offer a range of sandwiches, baguettes, wraps, salads and beverages.

Today, there are Boots branded stores outside the UK and Ireland in countries including United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Norway, Lithuania, The Netherlands, and Thailand.

Disney as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio, and established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action film production, television, and theme parks. The company also operated under the names The Walt Disney Studio, then Walt Disney Productions. Taking on its current name in 1986, it expanded its existing operations and also started divisions focused upon theater, radio, music, publishing, and online media. In addition, Disney has since created corporate divisions in order to market more mature content than is typically associated with its flagship family-oriented brands. The company is best known for the products of its film studio, The Walt Disney Studios, which is today one of the largest and best-known studios in American cinema. Disney also owns and operates the ABC broadcast television network; cable television networks such as Disney Channel, ESPN, A+E Networks, and ABC Family; publishing, merchandising, music, and theatre divisions; and owns and licenses 14 theme parks around the world. The company has been a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since May 6, 1991. An early and well-known cartoon creation of the company, Mickey Mouse, is a primary symbol of The Walt Disney Company.

In 1971, Waste Management went public, and by 1972, the company had made 133 acquisitions with $82M in revenue. It had 60,000 commercial and industrial accounts and 600,000 residential customers in 19 states and the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. In the 1980s, Waste Management acquired Service Corporation of America (SCA) to become the largest waste hauler in the country. Between the years of 1992 and 1997, the executive officers of Waste Management, Inc. began ""cooking"" the accounting books by refusing to record expenses necessary to write off the costs of unsuccessful and abandoned landfill development projects; establishing inflated environmental reserves (liabilities) in connection with acquisitions so that the excess reserves could be used to avoid recording unrelated operating expenses, improperly capitalizing a variety of expenses; failing to establish sufficient reserves (liabilities) to pay for income taxes and other expenses; avoiding depreciation expenses on their garbage trucks by both assigning unsupported and inflating salvage values and extending their useful lives; assigned arbitrary salvage values to other assets that previously had no salvage value; failed to record expenses for decreases in the value of landfills as they were filled with waste, used netting to eliminate approximately $490 million in current period operating expenses and accumulated prior period accounting misstatements by offsetting them against unrelated one-time gains on the sale or exchange of assets; and used geography entries to move tens of millions of dollars between various line items on the Company's income statement.

(June 2015) In 1987, USA Waste was founded in Oklahoma by Don Moorehead and moved the headquarters to Dallas, Texas, after buying out local haulers. After John Drury, CEO of BFI, got in a dispute with William Ruckelshaus, Drury left. He later became a part of USA Waste Services. He acquired Mid-American Waste Systems with co-founder George Moorehead; that boosted USA Waste. Waste Management is structured into the following units: Midwest Group Jeff Harris, Senior Vice President Western Group Duane C. Woods, Senior Vice President Eastern Group Brett Frazier, Senior Vice President Southern Group James E. Trevathan, Senior Vice President Current members of the board of directors of Waste Management are: John C. ""Jack"" Pope, David P. Steiner, Dr. Pastora San Juan Cafferty, Frank M. Clark, Jr., Pat Gross, Thomas I. Morgan, W. Robert Reum, and Steven G. Rothmeier. David P. Steiner is also the chief executive officer of the company (since 2004), succeeding A. Maurice Myers. Subsidiaries Electronics recycling, or ecycling, is another focus for Waste Management. This refers to the proper disposal of electronic items like televisions, computers, microwave ovens, cellular phones, VCRs and DVDs and other such products. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) encourages consumers to reuse and recycle these valuable products to keep them out of the waste stream. It January 2010, the company announced that WM Recycle America was implementing the Responsible Recycling (R2) Program for electronics recyclers, which establishes accepted practices to help protect the environment and workers’ health and safety while e-waste is handled. Waste Management is also involved in landfill gas utilization, including landfill-gas-to-energy (LFGTE) production. The company has over 115 LFTGE facilities, and plans to add another 60 facilities by 2012. S4 uses a process called plasma gasification (also known as plasma arc waste disposal) to heat waste materials until they break down to produce a synthesis gas, or syngas. The syngas can be converted into transportation fuels, such as ethanol or diesel, or can be used as a substitute for natural-gas heating and electricity. In February 2010, Waste Management announced a strategic investment agreement with Enerkem Inc., a Canadian-based company that specializes in converting waste materials that are most often landfilled, such as carbon-based feedstock, municipal solid waste, construction and demolition wood and agricultural and forest residues, into biofuels like ethanol. In 2005, Waste Management entered into a Software Licensing Agreement (SLA) with SAP AG. Under the agreement, SAP and its wholly owned subsidiary, Tomorrow Now, were to implement SAP's Enterprise Resource Planning software. The implementation began when an 8 months pilot program was established in Waste Management's New Mexico market area, the market-share area at the time. This initial implementation was to be followed in two months with a company-wide implementation from Waste Management's headquarters in Houston, Texas. Waste Management's operations consist of environmental protection, groundwater protection, environmental engineering, and air and gas management. Waste Management currently operates ten full-scale waste treatment landfill projects in the U.S. and Canada. As a member of the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), Waste Management made a commitment during the pilot phase to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by four percent below the average of its 1998–2001 baseline by 2006. Waste Management works with environmental groups in the U.S. to set aside land to create and manage wetlands and wildlife habitats. The company’s landfills currently provide approximately 21,000 acres (85&#160;km2) of protected land for wildlife; 73 landfills are certified In February 2010, Waste Management was the first company featured on CBS television series Undercover Boss. Chief Operating Officer Lawrence (Larry) O'Donnell, III learned of many policies he introduced but wished to change to improve the working environment of his employees. In one example, route supervisors sometimes observe garbage collecting to monitor quality, productivity and adherence to safety rules. Some garbage collectors perceived this as spying, a characterization that disturbed O'Donnell. In another example, O'Donnell chose to end the practice of deduction of pay for time clock rules violations during the lunch hour. O'Donnell personally intervened in the career of an administrative assistant he met while filming the series. The administrative assistant had put her family's house up for sale due to lack of sufficient income despite working two jobs. O'Donnell promoted the employee to a supervisor position, which included a higher rate of pay and bonus eligibility, thus allowing her to keep the house.

Waters_Corporation," This article needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (May 2015) Waters Corporation Type Public (NYSE:&#160;WAT) S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Life Sciences Founded 1958 Headquarters Milford, Massachusetts, USA Revenue US$ 1.90 billion (2013) The business was started by James (Jim) Logan Waters as Waters Associates in an office in the basement of a police station in Framingham, Massachusetts, in 1958. Waters enrolled in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, an officer training program, and graduated from Columbia University as an ensign with a B.S. degree in Physics in 1946. After stints as a university math teacher, Naval officer, project engineer, and entrepreneur, Waters formed Waters Associates in 1958. The fledgling firm’s first offices were in the rented basement of the Framingham, Mass. police station. During these years, Waters Associates was what is now referred to as a research boutique. Companies would contract Waters and his five employees to build one-of-a-kind instruments for various purposes. Early products included a boiler feedwater flame photometer, a balloon hydrometer, a nerve gas detector, a lab refractometer and process control refractometers. While from its start the company had been self-financed, with proceeds from an earlier business sale, Waters opened Waters Associates to external ownership in 1962. The company’s first major break came when Dow Chemical bought one of Waters’ first gel permeation chromatography instruments, Dow Chemical made an additional investment of $400,000. By 1979, Dow Chemical had attained nearly 25 percent ownership in Waters. In 1967, the ALC 100, the first Waters LC system, was brought to market. According to Leslie S. Ettre in a review about Jim Waters, pump, syringe injection, and two detectors: a Waters differential refractometer and a UV detector from the Laboratory Data Control (LDC) Co. In 1969, Dimitri D’Arbeloff, then president of Millipore Corporation, joined the corporation's board of directors. Millipore’s venture capital subsidiary made a $600,000 equity investment in Waters. Waters next big break came in 1972 when Dr. Helmut Hamberger, chief post-doc for Nobel Laureate Dr. Robert Woodward of Harvard University, sought Jim Waters’ help to the first synthesis of vitamin B12. Dr. Hamberger wanted to purify the positional isomers, which were needed to give him the right compound for the final stages of the synthesis. Working with Dr. Hamberger, the pair took two days to develop a separation, five more days to obtain larger columns to scale up the separation, and three more days to prep his material. In the end, the two had isolated and purified 200&#160;mg of the precursor compound. In 1972, Waters Associates appointed Frank Zenie president. A year later, headquarters moved from Framingham to a semi-rural 26-acre (110,000&#160;m2) site in Milford, Massachusetts. Waters became chairman, and continued in that role until the company merged with Millipore in 1980, and was rechristened the Waters Chromatograph Division. The sought-for synergies between the two companies never materialized, however. And, in 1993, Waters returned to independence under the leadership of Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer Douglas A. Berthiaume. In 1997 Waters entered mass spectrometry market with acquisition of Micromass for $176 million. On 11 June 2012, Waters India celebrated its silver jubilee anniversary in India. Waters’ main product brands include: ACQUITY UPLC Systems, ACQUITY UPC2 Systems, Xevo Mass Spectrometry Systems, Synapt MS Systems, Synapt HDMS Systems, XTerra HPLC Columns, XBridge Columns, ACQUITY UPLC columns, Alliance HPLC Systems, Empower Chromatography and MassLynx Mass Spectrometry Software, Oasis Sample Preparation Products, NuGenesis Lab Management System(LMS). Sources of Revenue A majority of the company's revenue is derived from the life science market, a market comprising drug discovery, drug development, quality control, and the emerging sciences of genomics, proteomics and biopharmaceuticals. Waters products are also sold into the food and beverage, environmental, fine chemical, personal care product, university, government, semiconductor, clinical and plastics markets sectors."
Anthem_Inc.," Anthem Inc. Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;ANTM S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Managed health care Founded Anthem Insurance and WellPoint Health Networks merger in 2004 Headquarters Indianapolis, Indiana, USA Key people Joseph R. Swedish - CEO Products Blue Cross Blue Shield revenue = US$61.7 Billion (FY 2012) Net income US$2.66 Billion (FY 2012) Total assets US$58.96 Billion (FY 2012) Total equity US$23.80 Billion (FY 2012) From its move to a publicly traded company in 2001 until its final merger in 2004, it merged the Blue Cross Blue Shield organizations of several states to achieve economy of scale, converting them in the process from non-profit to for-profit status. In late 2004, Anthem and WellPoint merged, with the combined company taking the WellPoint name. That Anthem no longer exists as a company, but the Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield brand name is used by WellPoint in 11 states. In October 2001, Anthem demutualized and conducted an initial public offering of common stock. WellPoint, Inc. (formerly Anthem, Inc.) was formed when WellPoint Health Networks Inc. and Anthem, Inc. merged in 2004 to become the nation's leading health benefits company. WellPoint Health Network Inc.'s predecessor was Blue Cross of California, which was founded in 1982 with the consolidation of Blue Cross of Northern California (established in 1936) and Blue Cross of Southern California (established in 1937). WellPoint was formed in 1992 to operate Blue Cross of California's managed care business. In 1993, Blue Cross of California spun off its managed care business into a separate publicly traded entity, WellPoint Health Networks Inc. In 1996, Blue Cross of California completed the conversion of all its business to for-profit status, resulting in a restructuring that designated WellPoint Health Networks Inc. as the parent organization. Anthem and WellPoint achieved a portion of this growth through mergers and acquisitions. Wellpoint, Inc. was formed in November 2004 following a merger of Anthem and WellPoint Health Networks Inc. 1995: Associated Group acquired Community Mutual Insurance (a provider of Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurance plans in Ohio with over 1.9 million policy holders), then set up Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Anthem Blue Cross (in full 'Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield') is a subsidiary of insurance giant Anthem Inc.. Anthem has about 800,000 customers, and has more individual policyholders in California than any other insurer. It is an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association based in Thousand Oaks, California. Blue Cross of California was WellPoint Health Network Inc.'s predecessor 1982: Blue Cross of California was founded with the consolidation of Blue Cross of Northern California (established in 1936) and Blue Cross of Southern California (established in 1937). 1992: WellPoint was formed to operate Blue Cross of California's managed care business. 1993, Blue Cross of California spun off its managed care business into a separate publicly traded entity, WellPoint Health Networks Inc. 2007: WellPoint, Inc. acquires Chicago based American Imaging Management (AIM), the leading radiology benefit management company. 2008: WellPoint acquired Resolution Health, a firm that analyzes patient history for potential medical problems such as adverse drug interactions. 2009: WellPoint acquired DeCare Dental (a dental insurance firm). In 2007, the California Department of Managed Health Care (DMHC), a California state regulatory agency, investigated Anthem Blue Cross's policies for revoking (rescinding) health care insurance policies. The DMHC randomly selected 90 instances where Anthem Blue Cross canceled the insurance of policy holders who had been diagnosed with costly or life-threatening illnesses, to find how many of these cancellations were legal. The agency concluded that all these cancellations were illegal. ""In all 90 files, there was no evidence  In July 2008, Anthem Blue Cross agreed to a settlement with the California Department of Managed Health Care. To resolve allegations of improper policy rescissions (cancellations), WellPoint paid $10 million and reinstated 1,770 policy-holders whose plans they had cancelled. They also agreed to provide compensation for any medical debts incurred by these policy-holders in the meantime. However, WellPoint did not officially admit liability. In April 2010, a report in Reuters alleged that Wellpoint ""using a computer algorithm, identified women recently diagnosed with breast cancer and then singled them out for cancellation of their policies."" ^ a b WellPoint Health Networks (WLP) annual SEC income statement filing via Wikinvest ^ a b WellPoint Health Networks (WLP) annual SEC balance sheet filing via Wikinvest ^ a b c Matthews, Anna Wilde (12 August 2014).

Wells Fargo is the second largest bank in deposits, home mortgage servicing, and debit cards. Wells Fargo ranked 10th among the Forbes Global 2000 (2015) and the 30th largest company in the United States, according to Fortune 500 (2015). The new company kept the Wells Fargo name to capitalize on the long history of the nationally recognized Wells Fargo name and its trademark stagecoach (the company's previous slogan, ""The Next Stage,"" is likely a nod to the company's trademark). After the acquisition, the parent company kept its headquarters in San Francisco. The company's current tagline, ""Together we'll go far"" also references the stagecoach motif, its customers, and represents the company name itself in a transposed way (Wells Far-go = we'll go-Far). A former Wachovia branch converted to Wells Fargo in the fall of 2011 in Durham, North Carolina. On October 3, 2008, Wachovia agreed to be bought by Wells Fargo for about $14.8&#160;billion in an all-stock transaction. This news came four days after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) made moves to have Citigroup buy Wachovia for $2.1&#160;billion. Citigroup protested Wachovia's agreement to sell itself to Wells Fargo and threatened legal action over the matter. However, the deal with Wells Fargo overwhelmingly won shareholder approval since it valued Wachovia at about seven times what Citigroup offered. To further ensure shareholder approval, Wachovia issued Wells Fargo with preferred stock holding 39.9% of the voting power in the company. Citigroup and Wells Fargo then entered into negotiations brokered by the FDIC to reach an amicable solution to the impasse. Those negotiations failed. Sources say that Citigroup was unwilling to take on more risk than the $42&#160;billion that would have been the cap under the previous FDIC-backed deal (with the FDIC incurring all losses over $42&#160;billion). Citigroup did not block the merger, but indicated they would seek damages of $60&#160;billion for breach of an alleged exclusivity agreement with Wachovia.

The Community Banking segment includes Regional Banking, Diversified Products and the Consumer Deposits groups, as well as Wells Fargo Customer Connection (formerly Wells Fargo Phone Bank, Wachovia Direct Access, the National Business Banking Center and Credit Card Customer Service). Wells Fargo also has around 2,000 stand alone mortgage branches throughout the country. Consumer Lending The wholesale banking segment contains products sold to large and middle market commercial companies, as well as to consumers on a wholesale basis. This includes lending, treasury management, mutual funds, asset-based lending, commercial real estate, corporate and institutional trust services, and capital markets and investment banking services through Wells Fargo Securities. One area that is very profitable to Wells Fargo, however, is asset-based lending: lending to large companies using accounts receivable and inventory as collateral, though less traditional assets are often included in the collateral package. Historically, this type of lending has been done when normal routes of raising funds, such as the Capital Markets or unsecured bank loans, have been exhausted. The main business unit associated with this activity is Wells Fargo Capital Finance. Wells Fargo also owns Eastdil Secured, which is described as a ""real estate investment bank"" but is essentially one of the largest commercial real estate brokers for very large transactions (such as the purchase and sale of large Class-A office buildings in central business districts throughout the United States). Wells Fargo Securities Wells Fargo Securities, LLC Type Subsidiary Industry Investment Banking Headquarters Charlotte, North Carolina Area served Worldwide Website WellsFargoSecurities.com The Seagram Building: Home of Wells Fargo Securities' New York offices and trading floors Wells Fargo Securities (""WFS"") is the investment banking division of Wells Fargo &amp; Co. It is the 9th largest in the U.S. (2011 fee estimates from Thomson SDC) and exists today as an amalgamation of several legacy enterprises, most notably Wachovia Securities. The size and financial performance of the group is not disclosed publicly, but analysts believe the investment banking group houses approximately 4,500 employees and generates between $3 and $4 billion per year in investment banking revenue. By comparison, two of Wells Fargo’s largest competitors, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Chase generate approximately $5.5 billion and $6 billion respectively (not including sales and trading revenue). Other banks have attempted to emulate Wells Fargo's cross-selling practices (described by The Wall Street Journal as a hard sell technique); Wells Fargo has an office in the Middle East, in Dubai at Dubai Financial Centre. Wells Fargo has a presence in India as well. Wells Fargo India Solutions (WFIS) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Wells Fargo in India. Wells Fargo gave over 1,900 Small Business Administration (SBA) loans from late 2012 to early 2013. Wells Fargo Bank was the fifth largest bank at the end of 2008 as an individual bank. (Not including subsidiaries) Major shareholders On February 9, 2012, it was announced that the five largest mortgage servicers (Ally/GMAC, Bank of America, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo) agreed to a historic settlement with the federal government and 49 states. The settlement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement (NMS), required the servicers to provide about $26 billion in relief to distressed homeowners and in direct payments to the states and federal government. This settlement amount makes the NMS the second largest civil settlement in U.S. history, only trailing the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. The fine has come at a time that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has launched an investigation of Wells Fargo into racial discrimination practices, the second federal probe in 2012 of alleged violations of misconduct with regard to race. The other, began in 2011 by the National Fair Housing Alliance has found ""overwhelming"" and ""troubling"" evidence that six of the nation's major banks handle foreclosures in neighborhoods populated primarily by minorities differently than in white communities. On October 9, 2012, the U.S. federal government sued the bank under the False Claims Act at the federal court in Manhattan, New York. The suit alleges that Wells Fargo defrauded the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) over the past ten years, underwriting over 100,000 FHA backed loans when over half did not qualify for the program. This suit is the third allegation levied against Wells Fargo in 2012.

Western Digital Corporation has a long history in the electronics industry as an integrated circuit maker and a storage products company. Western Digital was founded on April 23, 1970, by Alvin B. Phillips, a Motorola employee, as General Digital, initially (and briefly) a manufacturer of MOS test equipment. It rapidly became a speciality semiconductor maker, with start-up capital provided by several individual investors and industrial giant Emerson Electric. Around July 1971, it adopted its current name and soon introduced its first product, the WD1402A UART.

That controller, the WD1003, became the basis of the ATA interface (which WDC developed along with Compaq and Control Data Corporation's MPI division, now owned by Seagate Technology), starting in 1986. Throughout most of the 1980s, the family of controllers based on the WD1003 provided the bulk of WDC's revenues and profits, and for a time generated enormous corporate growth. Western Digital Paradise VGA card, 8-bit ISA bus, circa 1989 Much of the mid-to-late 1980s saw an effort by WDC to use the profits from their ATA storage controllers to become a general-purpose OEM hardware supplier for the PC industry. As a result, WDC purchased a number of hardware companies. These included graphics cards (through its Paradise subsidiary, purchased 1986, which became Western Digital Imaging), core logic chipsets (by purchasing Faraday Electronics Inc. in 1987), SCSI controller chips for disk and tape devices (by purchasing ADSI in 1986), networking (WD8003, WD8013 Ethernet and WD8003S StarLAN). They did well (especially Paradise, which produced one of the best VGA cards of the era), but storage-related chips and disk controllers were their biggest money makers. In 1986, they introduced the WD33C93 single-chip SCSI interface, which was used in the first 16-bit bus mastering SCSI host adapter, the WD7000 ""FASST""; in 1987 they introduced the WD37C65, a single-chip implementation of the PC/AT's floppy disk controller circuitry, and the grandfather of modern super I/O chips; in 1988 they introduced the WD42C22 ""Vanilla"", the first single-chip ATA hard disk controller. 1988 also brought what would be the biggest change in WDC's history. That year, WDC bought the hard drive production assets of PC hardware maker Tandon; the first products of that union under WDC's own name were the ""Centaur"" series of ATA and XT attachment drives. Western Digital Tidbit 60 (WDAH260) - 62.3 MB (2.5 inch drive mounted in 3.5 inch adapter bracket) Western Digital Caviar 80&#160;MB (model number WDAC280-32), from a series of HDDs for desktop PCs; it is a 3.5-inch HDD mounted onto a 5.25-inch adapter bracket. By 1991, things were starting to slow down, as the PC industry moved from ST-506 and ESDI drives to ATA and SCSI, and thus were buying fewer hard disk controller boards. That year saw the rise of WDC's Caviar drives, brand new designs that used the latest in embedded servo and computerized diagnostic systems. Eventually, the successful sales of the Caviar drives resulted in WDC starting to sell some of its divisions. Paradise was sold to Philips, and since disappeared. Its networking and floppy drive controller divisions went to SMC Networks and its SCSI chip business went to Future Domain, which was later bought out by market leader Adaptec. Around 1995, the technological lead that the Caviar drives had enjoyed was eclipsed by newer offerings from other companies, especially Quantum Corp., and WDC fell into a slump. Products and ideas of this time did not go far. The Portfolio drive (a 3-inch (76&#160;mm) form factor model, developed with JT Storage) was a flop, as was the SDX hard disk to CD-ROM interface. WDC's drives started to slip further behind competing products, and quality began to suffer; system builders and PC enthusiasts who used to recommend WD above all else, were going to the competition, particularly Maxtor, whose products had improved significantly by the late 1990s. In an attempt to turn the tide in 1998, WDC recruited the help of IBM. This agreement gave WDC the rights to use certain IBM technologies, including giant magneto-resistive (GMR) heads and access to IBM production facilities. The result was the Expert line of drives, introduced in early 1999. The idea worked, and WDC regained respect in the press and among users, even despite a recall in 2000 (which was due to bad motor driver chips). WDC later broke ties to IBM. 2000s Western Digital WD740GD 74&#160;GB Raptor, a 10,000&#160;rpm 3.5-inch HDD In 2001, Western Digital became the first manufacturer to offer mainstream ATA hard disk drives with 8&#160;MiB of disk buffer. At that time, most desktop hard disk drives had 2&#160;MB of buffer. WDC labeled these 8&#160;MB models as ""Special Edition"" and distinguished them with the JB code (the 2&#160;MB models had the BB code). The first 8&#160;MB cache drive was the 100&#160;GB WD1000JB, followed by other models starting with 40&#160;GB capacity. WDC advertised the JB models for cost-effective file servers. In October 2001, WD restated its prior year results to reflect the adoption of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No.101 and the reclassification of Connex and SANavigator results as discontinued operations. In 2003, WD acquired most of the assets of bankrupt one-time market leading magnetic hard drive read-write head developer Read-Rite Corporation. In the same year, WD offered the first 10,000&#160;rpm Serial ATA HDD, the WD360GD ""Raptor"", with a capacity of 36&#160;GB and an average access time of less than six milliseconds. Soon, the 74&#160;GB WD740GD followed, which was also much quieter. In 2004, Western Digital redesigned its logo for the first time since 1997, with the design of new logo focusing on the company's initials (""WD"")., the WD Raptor drives have a five-year warranty, making them a more attractive choice for inexpensive storage servers, where a large number of drives in constant use increases the likelihood of a drive failure. In 2006, Western Digital introduced its My Book line of mass market external hard drives that feature a compact book-like design. On October 7, 2007, Western Digital released several editions of a single 1&#160;TB hard drive, the largest in its My Book line. In 2007, Western Digital acquired magnetic media maker Komag. Also in the same year, Western Digital adopted perpendicular recording technology in its line of notebook and desktop drives. This allowed it to produce notebook and desktop drives in the largest classes of the time. Western Digital also started to produce the energy efficient GP (Green Power) Two third-generation 1&#160;TB VelociRaptors in IcePack mounting frames On April 21, 2008, Western Digital announced the next generation of its 10,000&#160;rpm SATA WD Raptor series of hard drives. The new drives, called WD VelociRaptor, featured 300&#160;GB capacity and 2.5-inch (64&#160;mm) platters enclosed in the IcePack, a 3.5-inch (89&#160;mm) mounting frame with a built-in heat sink. Western Digital said that the new drives are 35 percent faster than the previous generation. On September 12, 2008, Western Digital shipped a 500&#160;GB 2.5-inch (64&#160;mm) notebook hard drive which is part of their Scorpio Blue series of notebook hard drives. On January 27, 2009, Western Digital shipped the first 2&#160;TB internal hard disk drive. In April 2010, Western Digital acquired the magnetic glass media sputtering operations of HOYA Corporation and HOYA Magnetics Singapore Pte. Ltd (HOMS). While Western Digital had previously acquired other magnetic glass media sputtering operations, the purchase of HOMS gave Western Digital an edge in its strive to produce high-end hard disk drives using magnetic glass media. i.e. by 2010, there were three surviving independent HDD glass media manufacturing plants, namely Showa Denko, Fuji Electric &amp; HOYA Magnetics. In July 2012, Western Digital announced a ""Red"" series of drives, designed for network-attached storage (NAS) devices. This series of drives has a special firmware designed for Home/Small Business environments, has better reliability than standard desktop drives, is more energy efficient and comes with a 3-year warranty. In November 2013, Western Digital (through its HGST subsidiary) showed off new helium-filled 6&#160;TB Ultrastar He6 hard disk drives. When compared to regular air-filled HDDs, they claim 49% of reduction in power usage per terabyte of storage.

In 1861 it opened the first transcontinental telegraph. In 1865 it formed the Russian–American Telegraph in an attempt to link America to Europe, via Alaska, into Siberia, to Moscow (This project was abandoned in 1867). The company enjoyed phenomenal growth during the next few years. Under the leadership of presidents Jeptha Wade and William Orton its capitalization rose from $385,700 in 1858 to $41 million in 1876. However it was top-heavy with stock issues, and faced growing competition from several firms, especially the Atlantic and Pacific Telegraph Company—itself taken over by financier Jay Gould in 1875. As the telephone replaced the telegraph, money transfer would become its primary business. When the Dow Jones Transportation Average stock market index for the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was created in 1884, Western Union was one of the original eleven all-American companies tracked. By 1900, Western Union operated a million miles of telegraph lines and two international undersea cables. 20th century Western Union introduced the 'Candygram' in the 1960s, a box of chocolates accompanying a telegram featured in a commercial with the rotund Don Wilson. On the 1970s version of Let's Make a Deal hosted by Monty Hall Western Union Candygrams with a cash message inside were offered to contestants as a prize during a deal. In 1964, Western Union initiated a transcontinental microwave system to replace land lines. During World War II, families with sons in military service dreaded the Western Union ""boy on his bicycle"" to arrive at their home with a telegram from the War Department or the Navy Department. The message began: The Secretary of War (for soldiers and airmen) or Secretary of Navy (for sailors and marines), regrets to inform you that  was killed in action (or missing in action). Advertisement for Western Union ""Tourate"" telegram service, 1939 Western Union became the first American telecommunications corporation to maintain its own fleet of geosynchronous communications satellites, starting in 1974. The fleet of satellites, called Westar, carried communications within the Western Union company for telegram and mailgram message data to Western Union bureaus nationwide. It also handled traffic for its Telex and TWX (Telex II) services. The Westar satellites' transponders were also leased by other companies for relaying video, voice, data, and facsimile (fax) transmissions. In 1963, Western Union organized its international cable system properties and its right-of-way for connecting international telegraph lines into a separate company called Western Union International (WUI) which it divested that year to American Securities. In 1983, American Securities sold WUI to MCI Communications which renamed it to MCI International and moved its headquarters from New York City to Rye Brook, New York. In the 1970s, WUI installed and leased to the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) dedicated 50 Kbps high-speed telecommunications facilities between the continental U.S. and Hawaii, Germany and the United Kingdom to provide a test bed for the DOD's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). This test bed provided ARPA with a proof of concept for the technology of packet switching which later became the Internet. In 1976, Western Union partnered with E. F. Hutton &amp; Co.. In 1981, Western Union purchased a fifty percent interest in Airfone. It sold Airfone to GTE in 1986 for $39 million in cash. Example of a Western Union Telegram, 1959. Note that the message text is a continuous strip of paper which was cut and glued to the telegram form. In 1987, Investor Bennett S. LeBow acquired control of Western Union through an outside of chapter 11 process that was a complex leveraged recapitalization. The transaction was backed by a total of $900 million in high-yield bonds and preferred stock underwritten by Michael Milken's group at Drexel Burnham Lambert as part of an exchange offer. LeBow installed Robert J. Amman as President and CEO who led a complete strategic, operational and balance sheet restructuring of the company over the subsequent 6 years. Mr. Amman executed a strategy of redirecting Western Union from being an asset-based provider of communications services, with a money transfer business as a large but less important part of the business, into being a provider of consumer-based money transfer financial services. In so doing, Mr. Amman ran the company as two separate companies. One business consisted of the money transfer business, which was funded and operated to take advantage of the significant growth opportunity. The second unit consisted of all the non-strategic communications assets such as the long-distance analog voice network, satellite business and undersea cable assets. In the 3-year period through 1990 Mr. Amman was supported by Robert A. Schriesheim, also installed by Mr. LeBow, as a special advisor who oversaw the divestiture of the four non-strategic telecommunications assets for about $280 million. The official name of the corporation was changed to New Valley Corporation in 1991, just in time for that entity to seek bankruptcy protection as part of Mr. Amman's strategy to eliminate the overleveraged balance sheet while continuing to grow the money transfer business . The name change was taken to shield the Western Union name from being dragged through the proceedings (and the bad PR that would cause). Western Union telegrams were transmitted through a store and forward message switching system. Early versions were manual telegraph systems. Later systems using teleprinters were semi-automatic, using punched paper tape to receive, store, and retransmit messages. Plan 55-A, Western Union's last paper tape based switching system (1948–1976), was fully automatic, with automatic routing. Western Union was a prime contractor in the Automatic Digital Network (AUTODIN) program. AUTODIN, a military application for communication, was first developed in the 1960s and became the precursor to the modern Internet in the 1990s. The Defense Message System (DMS) replaced AUTODIN in 2000. AUTODIN, originally named ""ComLogNet"", was a highly reliable service that operated at 99.99% availability, using mechanical punched card readers and tab machines to send and receive data over leased lines. During the peak operation of AUTODIN, the United States portion of the network handled twenty million messages a month. Western Union failed in its attempts to engineer a replacement (AUTODIN II), leading to the development of an acceptable packet-switched network by BBN (the developer of the ARPANET) which became the foundation of today's Internet. AUTODIN service ceased in 2000, years after it had become obsolete. A related innovation that came from AUTODIN was Western Union's computer based EasyLink service. This system allowed for one of the first marketable email systems for non-government users. In addition, the system allowed the same message to be sent simultaneously to multiple recipients via email, fax, mailgram, or telex services as well as allowing messages to be sent from the integrated formats. With the service, users could also perform research utilizing its InfoLink application. EasyLink Services is now its own company. End of telegrams In order to send funds, a sender goes to a Western Union office and presents funds (plus fees) for ""Next Day"" or ""Money in Minutes"" service. The sender provides his or her name and address, the recipient's name, and a designated payment destination. Western Union then provides the sender a 10-digit Money Transfer Control Number (MTCN) that the sender must provide to the recipient. The recipient then proceeds to a Western Union agent office in the designated payment location, presents the 10-digit MTCN, and a photo ID. Money is then paid out to the recipient. In some locations, if a recipient lacks identification documents, the sender and receiver can set up a pre-arranged password. Funds are paid out in cash, although if payment exceeds a local maximum or cash on hand, a check is issued. Alternatively, a sender may forward funds to a recipient by using Western Union's website or by phone. In some countries, the recipient doesn’t need the MTCN number if he has sufficient identification. Transfer fees WU phone parlors near Times Square, 2008 Along with satellite telecommunications, Western Union was also active in other forms of telecommunication services: Common carrier terrestrial microwave networks Business communications networks such as Telex and TWX, which was acquired from AT&amp;T Corporation and renamed Telex II by Western Union Landline-based leased voice and data communication circuits Long distance telephone service Airfone air-ground radiotelephone service from 1981 to 1986 Cellular phone service for a very short time in the early 1980s (the phones were made by two-way radio manufacturer E. F. Johnson Company) Most of these services were discontinued by Western Union in the late 1980s due to a lack of profitability, with the company's divisions providing said services being divested and sold to other companies, such as the 1988 sale of WU's satellite fleet and services to Hughes Space and Communications, and the sale of WU's Airfone service to GTE in 1986.

Following a failed business venture, Lou acquired a patent to a manual clothes washer and he approached Emory to see if he could add an electric motor to the design. With the aid of a $5,000 investment from retailing executive Lowell Bassford, they began to produce electric motor-driven wringer washers. Whirlpool acquires appliance division from International Harvester Company. In 1956, a 100-acre (0.40&#160;km2) administrative center was opened in Benton Harbor, Michigan. In 1957, the RCA Whirlpool Miracle Kitchen was introduced with an estimated 15 million television viewers. The company changed its name back to Whirlpool Corporation. In 1962, the company's research laboratories won a contract from NASA to develop the food and waste management system for Project Gemini. The following year, Whirlpool opened a new manufacturing plant in Cleveland, Tennessee replacing a 123-year-old facility. The $200 million project added about 130 jobs to an established workforce of 1,500. The 1-million-square-foot (93,000&#160;m2) facility manufactures premium cooking appliances for Whirlpool's portfolio of brands. The project also includes a distribution center.

Type Public Traded&#160;as NASDAQ:&#160;WFM NASDAQ-100 Component S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Grocery store Health food store Founded September&#160;20, 1980; 35 years ago&#160;(1980-09-20) Founder John Mackey Headquarters Austin, Texas, United States Number of locations 431 (September 2015) Key people John B. Elstrott (Chairman) John Mackey (Co-CEO) Walter Robb (Co-CEO) Jason Buechel (CIO) Revenue US$ 12.9&#160;billion (2013)  US$ 11.7&#160;billion (2012)  Operating income US$ 883.0&#160;million (2013)  US$ 744.0&#160;million (2012)  Net income US$ 551.0&#160;million (2013)  US$ 466.0&#160;million (2012)  Total assets US$ 5.5&#160;billion (2013)  US$ 5.3&#160;billion (2012)  Total equity US$ 3.9&#160;billion (2013)  US$ 3.8&#160;billion (2012)  In 1978, Mackey and Renee Lawson borrowed $45,000 from family and friends to open a small natural foods store called SaferWay in Austin, (the name being a spoof of Safeway). When the two were evicted from their apartment for storing food products in it, they decided to live at the store. Because it was zoned for commercial use, there was no shower stall, so they bathed using a water hose attached to their dishwasher. Two years later, John Mackey partnered with Craig Weller and Mark Skiles to merge SaferWay with the latter's Clarksville Natural Grocery, resulting in the opening of the original Whole Foods Market. At 10,500 square feet (980&#160;m2) and with a staff of 19, the store was quite large in comparison to the standard health food store of the time. The produce department of a new Whole Foods Market located in the Southern Hills area of Tulsa, OK. A Bread &amp; Circus and Whole Foods bakery Beginning in 1984, Whole Foods Market expanded out of Austin, first to Houston and Dallas and then into New Orleans with the purchase of The Whole Food Co. in 1988. In 1989, the company expanded to the West Coast with a store in Palo Alto, Calif. While opening new stores, the company fueled rapid growth by acquiring other natural foods chains throughout the 1990s: Wellspring Grocery of North Carolina, Bread &amp; Circus of Massachusetts and Rhode Island (banner retired in 2003), Mrs. Gooch’s Natural Foods Markets of Los Angeles, Bread of Life of Northern California, Fresh Fields Markets on the East Coast and in the Midwest, Florida Bread of Life stores, Detroit-area Merchant of Vino stores, and Nature’s Heartland of Boston. In 2005, Whole Foods opened its 80,000&#160;sq&#160;ft (7,400&#160;m2) flagship store in downtown Austin. The company's headquarters moved into offices above the store. In June 2007, it opened its first full-size store, a total of 80,000&#160;sq&#160;ft (7,400&#160;m2) on three levels, on the site of the old Barkers department store in Kensington High Street, West London. Company executives claimed that as many as forty stores might eventually be opened throughout the U.K. On June 27, 2007, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued an administrative complaint challenging Whole Foods Market, Inc.'s acquisition of Wild Oats Markets Inc. According to the complaint, the FTC believed that the proposed transaction would violate federal antitrust laws by eliminating the substantial competition between two close competitors in the operation of premium natural and organic supermarkets nationwide. The FTC contended that if the transaction were to proceed Whole Foods Market would have the ability to raise prices and reduce quality and services. Both Whole Foods Market and Wild Oats stated their intention to vigorously oppose the FTC's complaint and a court hearing on the issue was scheduled for July 31 and August 1, 2007. CEO John Mackey started a blog on the subject to explain his opposition to the FTC's stance. Further blogging by Mackey was revealed when the FTC released papers detailing highly opinionated comments under the pseudonym ""Rahodeb"" that he made to the Whole Foods Yahoo! investment message board. This became the subject of an investigation when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) noted that Regulation Fair Disclosure law of 2000 may have been violated. On July 29, 2008, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia overturned the district court's decision allowing the merger. The Court of Appeals ruled that ""premium natural, and organic supermarkets"" (""PNOS""), such as Whole Foods and Wild Oats, constitute a distinct submarket of all grocers. The court ruled that ""mission driven"" consumers (those with an emphasis on social and environmental responsibility) would be adversely affected by the merger because substantial evidence by the FTC showed that Whole Foods intended to raise prices after consummation of the merger. Whole Foods Market has also announced that it does not intend to sell meat or milk from cloned animals or their offspring, even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has ruled them safe to eat. Whole Foods plastics recycling bin at the 2011 Ann Arbor Summer Festival In May 1999, Whole Foods Market joined the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), a global independent, not-for-profit organization promoting sustainable fisheries and responsible fishing practices world-wide to help preserve fish stocks for future generations. A January 8, 2007, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report listed Whole Foods Market as the second-highest purchaser of green power nationwide, citing its actions as helping drive the development of new renewable energy sources for the electricity generation. The EPA report showed Whole Foods Market using 463.1 million kilowatt hours annually. It was covered, 100 percent net-wise, by its total electricity from biomass, geothermal, small-hydro, solar, and wind sources. In 2002, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) began petitioning Whole Foods to take steps to ensure the improvement of treatment of animals sold in the stores. Whole Foods created the Animal Compassion Foundation in January 2005, a separate nonprofit organization, to help other producers evolve their practices to raise animals naturally and humanely. According to Whole Foods Natural Meat Quality Standards and Animal Compassionate Standards, pulling feathers from live ducks, bill trimming, bill heat treatment, toe punching, slitting the webs of the feet, and toe removal are all prohibited in the raising of ducks for Whole Foods Market. Any ducks treated in this manner, treated with antibiotics or antimicrobials, cloned, genetically modified, or not allowed medical treatment when necessary are to be removed from Whole Foods Market stock. Substances such as Bisphenol A (BPA), found in products such as baby bottles and children’s cups, are controversial. Whole Foods no longer sells baby bottles and children’s cups made with BPA. The corporation has also been criticized for its aggressive policy of promoting its own in-house brands (e.g. 365) at the expense of smaller or local independent brands. a family-owned rabbit meat business. In January 2015, a group of activists organized under the network Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) released a video of laying hens from a Northern California farm that supplies eggs to Whole Foods. In the video, which featured footage of crowded, dirty henhouses and injured birds, DxE contended that the hens' welfare was severely compromised, even though numerous boards had labeled the farm as ""Certified Humane"". The company maintains that its treatment of workers obviates the needs for unions: At its U.S. stores, after 800 service hours, full-time workers are given an option to purchase health insurance coverage starting at $20 per paycheck for themselves (spouse and dependent coverage is offered for an additional charge). Whole Foods Market suburban store in Redwood City, California Whole Food's health insurance plan is notable for its high deductibles – $2000 for general medical expenses, and $1000 for prescriptions. However, employees receive $300 to $1800 per year (depending on years of service) in personal wellness funds. Once an employee has met the deductibles, insurance covers 80% of general medical costs and prescriptions but not for any type of mental illness. CEO Mackey drew attention to the insurance program (offered through United Health Care in the US) for its employees in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. An attempt at unionizing in Madison, Wisconsin, in 2002 was met with resistance from store management and Whole Foods was accused by labor activists of union busting. A 2004 ruling by the National Labor Relations Board upheld the actions of Whole Foods at the Madison store. Further attempts at unionizing Whole Foods Market stores have been unsuccessful. Whole Foods was criticized for its refusal to support a campaign by the United Farm Workers (UFW) on behalf of agricultural workers laboring on strawberry farms."

Website www.williams.com The Williams Companies, Inc. is an energy company based in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Its core business is natural gas processing and transportation, with additional petroleum and electricity generation assets. A Fortune 500 company, its common stock is a component of the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones Utility Average. Contents 1 History 2 Telecommunications 3 Lawsuits and fines 4 Restatement 5 References 6 External links History The company went public in 1957 under the Williams Brothers name. As it diversified in the 1970s, it was renamed The Williams Companies, Inc. Since 1997, their brand identity has been simplified to ""Williams"". In 1966, Williams bought the then-largest petroleum products pipeline in America, known as the Great Lakes Pipe Line Company, for about $287 million. In 1982, it expanded into natural gas transportation with the purchase of Northwest Energy Company, and extended their reach to the East Coast with the 1995 purchase of Transco Energy Company. In 2001, Williams acquired Barrett Resources, which provided them with additional national gas reserves. In 2002, the company found itself in financial distress due to changed market conditions and the large debt of its subsidiary Williams Communications Group. The company obtained and paid off an emergency high interest loan from Warren Buffett to stay out of bankruptcy, and redirected its focus toward natural gas production, processing, and transportation as well as increasing its resource holdings. One of the moves it made around that time (2004) was the sale of 3 of Canada's largest natural gas treatment plants (extracts natural gas liquids from it) to Inter Pipeline Fund for US$540 million. On February 16, 2011, Williams' board of directors had approved pursuing a plan to separate the company's businesses into two stand-alone, publicly traded corporations. The plan calls for Williams to separate its exploration and production business via an initial public offering (IPO) in third-quarter 2011 of up to 20 percent of its interest and, in 2012, a tax-free spinoff to Williams shareholders of its remaining interest. The company helped to get the modern telecommunications industry off the ground by running fiber optic cable through its decommissioned pipelines. It built two nationwide networks, which have since become their own companies; the first was sold in 1995 to LDDS (which would become WorldCom &amp; then MCI) and the second was spun off in 2001 as Williams Communications (which would become WilTel Communications and later consolidate into Level 3 Communications).

(July 2015) Headquarters building in Milwaukee 1896 The Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company was formed as a subsidiary of the North American Company to provide interurban rail service in a 12,000-square-mile (31,000&#160;km2) area of southeastern Wisconsin. In time, the company began selling electricity not needed to power the interurban trains to individuals and businesses. 1919 Experiments at the company's East Wells Power Plant (then called Oneida Street Plant) in downtown Milwaukee, proved that use of pulverized coal reduced the cost of producing electric power and conserved fuel. 1921 Wisconsin Electric Power Company is formed by the North American Company to build and operate the Lakeside Power Plant in St. Francis, Wisconsin. Lakeside was the world's first power plant to burn pulverized coal exclusively. 1935 The first of five 80-megawatt units at Port Washington Power Plant was brought on line. From 1935 to 1948, Port Washington was the most efficient coal-fueled power plant in the world. 1938 Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light was merged into Wisconsin Electric. 1941 Wisconsin Electric purchased Wisconsin Gas &amp; Electric Company and Wisconsin Michigan Power Company, which also had been under the North American Company. 1946 Wisconsin Electric becomes an independent company, no longer part of the North American Company. 1953 Wisconsin Electric placed into service the first 120-megawatt unit at Oak Creek Power Plant. Seven additional units were completed through 1968. 1970 Wisconsin Electric's 908-megawatt Point Beach Nuclear Plant began operation and gained a world-wide reputation for efficiency. 1980 Wisconsin Electric placed the first 580-megawatt unit at Pleasant Prairie into service. A second unit was added in 1985. 1987 Wisconsin Electric restructured, establishing Wisconsin Energy Corporation and the Wispark, Wisvest and Witech subsidiaries. 1994 Wisconsin Energy purchased Lake Geneva-based Wisconsin Southern Gas Co. and merged it into Wisconsin Natural, which subsequently merged with Wisconsin Electric in 1995. 1998 Wisconsin Energy bought ESELCO, parent company of the Edison Sault Electric Company, based in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. 2000 WICOR, holding company of Wisconsin Gas, became part of Wisconsin Energy, creating the largest electric and natural gas provider in Wisconsin. The corporation also announced a 10-year plant to invest US$7.0 billion to build five new power plants, to upgrade existing plants and to improve its electric distribution system. 2001 American Transmission Company, the first multi-state all-transmission utility in the United States, was formed by Wisconsin's major utilities, and Wisconsin Electric transferred ownership of its transmission lines to American Transmission in exchange for shares in the new company. 2002 Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas began doing business as We Energies. 2004 Wisconsin Energy sold the non-energy assets of WICOR for US$850 million as part of its strategy to divest its non-core businesses. 2005 Construction of two 615-megawatt coal-fired units began at the Oak Creek Power Plant site. The same year, the first of two 545-megawatt natural-gas-fueled units began commercial operation at Port Washington Generating Station. 2007 Wisconsin Energy sold Point Beach Nuclear Plant to FPL Energy for approximately US$924 million, with We Energies entitled to the output for the life of the plant. 2008 The Blue Sky Green Field Wind Farm began operation on a 10,600-acre (43&#160;km2) site with 88 turbines (145-megawatt capacity) in Wisconsin's Fond du Lac County. 2009 We Energies received approval to construct and operate the Glacier Hills Wind Park in Wisconsin's Columbia County. The company also announced plans to build a biomass generating facility at the Domtar paper mill in Rothschild, Wisconsin. 2010 The first of two 615-megawatt coal-fueled units at the company's Oak Creek expansion site attains commercial operation on Feb. 2. Wisconsin Energy completed the sale of Edison Sault Electric Company to Cloverland Electric Cooperative. In May, construction began on the Glacier Hills Wind Park in Columbia County. 2011 The second of two 615-megawatt coal-fueled units at the company's Oak Creek expansion site attains commercial operation on Jan. 12. Glacier Hills Wind Park began operating 90 turbines in the towns of Randolph and Scott in Wisconsin. 2013 A 50-megawatt, biomass-based, cogeneration facility in Rothschild, Wisconsin, began commercial operation to provide base-load power for the electric system and steam to the Domtar paper mill. 2014 Wisconsin Energy announced that it was purchasing Integrys Energy Group for $9.1 billion. 2015 Wisconsin Energy completes acquisition of Integrys Energy Group, forming WEC Energy Group. Primergy merger On May 3, 1995, Wisconsin Energy Corporation and Northern States Power Company (NYSE:&#160;NSP) each filed a Securities and Exchange Commission Form 8-K to combine in a merger-of-equals transaction to form Primergy Corporation. It would have been the 10th largest investor-owned electric and gas utility company in the United States, based on market capitalization at that time of about US$6.0 billion. NSP would have been the nominal survivor, and the merged company would be headquartered in Minneapolis (headquarters of the old NSP), but the merged company would have been registered in Wisconsin. On May 16, 1997, both CEOs announced that the boards of directors of both companies had terminated the merger plan because of approval delays by the U.S. Department of Justice, the SEC, and state regulators in Minnesota and Wisconsin., WEC Energy Group, July 29 ^ North American Co. v.

The company's first project, Wynn Las Vegas, opened on April 28, 2005. Wynn Macau, the company's second project started construction on June 28, 2004. It opened September 5, 2006. Encore, an extension to Wynn Las Vegas, broke ground on April 28, 2006, the first anniversary of the opening of Wynn Las Vegas. Steve Wynn announced a planned redevelopment of the golf course at Wynn Las Vegas, called Wynn Golf and Country Club, into two separate resorts, and a large lake, connected by the ""Wynn Parkway"". Redevelopment will not take place before 2009. Encore at Wynn Macau, the company's second project in Macau Peninsula, Macau, People's Republic of China, opened on April 21, 2010. Wynn bought 52 acres (21&#160;ha) of the Cotai Strip in Macau where he hopes to break ground in 2012 for Wynn Cotai for a 2013 or early 2014 opening. The company considered opening a casino as part of the Entertainment City development in the Philippines, but decided against it because of corruption in the country's gaming industry. In Las Vegas, the 1st quarter of 2009 was the first where the Encore was fully operational after its opening on December 22, 2008. The prior year quarter includes only Wynn Las Vegas. Overall revenue from the resort increased from $327.2 to $345.9 in the first quarter, a very modest increase considering the additional hotel tower and new food and beverage outlets. Despite the additional casino at the Encore (which added 97 tables and 857 slot machines to the original 190 tables and 2000 slots) net casino revenues for the combined resort were lower than the first quarter of 2008 when only The Wynn was operating. Net casino revenues for the combined resort dropped from $125.1 million to $117.5 million. Gross non-casino revenues for the quarter were $228.4 million, a 13.3% increase from the first quarter of 2008, driven primarily by higher hotel and food and beverage revenues resulting from the opening of Encore. Although the added 2,034 suites at Encore nearly doubled the suites in the property hotel revenues were up only 20.6% to $85.1 million during the quarter, versus $70.6 million in the first quarter of 2008 due to declining room rates and lower occupancy rate. Food and beverage revenues increased as a result of the additional 12 food and beverage outlets located in the Encore expansion. Retail revenues declined and entertainment revenues also decreased primarily due to the closure of the Spamalot production show in July 2008. ^ a b ""Two of a kind"", Fortune (paper)|format= requires |url= (help), 29 April 2013, p.&#160;22&#160; ^ a b Stutz, Howard (18 March 2008).

Southwestern Public Service Co. (SPS) dates its origins to 1904 and the Pecos Valley in New Mexico when Maynard Gunsell received an electricity franchise for the city of Roswell, New Mexico and its 2,000 residents. The financial strain of creating this new enterprise soon overwhelmed him and he sold the franchise to W.H. Gillenwater, who named his utility the Roswell Electric Light Co. He later sold the company to an investment firm in Cleveland, Ohio, which already owned the Roswell Gas Co. While the bulk of NSP's territory grew across central and southern Minnesota (starting from the Twin Cities), it acquired territory in North Dakota (centering on Fargo, Grand Forks, and Minot) and extended southwest into South Dakota (centering on Sioux Falls). NSP's system also extended east into Wisconsin, but because of utility ownership laws in that state, it was operated as an entity separate from the rest of the company. Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo) was formed in 1923 to provide an electric generating station for the Denver area. By 1924, it had acquired most of the electric companies in northern and central Colorado. Originally a subsidiary of Cities Service Company, it became an independent autonomous operation in November 1943. By this time, it served 80 percent of Colorado’s gas and electricity needs. As demand for energy continued to grow, so did PSCo. Eventually, the company merged with SPS to form New Century Energies (NCE) in 1995. Northern States Power and Wisconsin Energy Corporation had planned to merge into a new outfit that was to be called Primergy - but the merger fell through because of the time it was taking to gain the required approvals from state and federal agencies. After the failed Primergy merger, NSP (both the Minnesota and Wisconsin companies) merged with New Century Energies to form Xcel Energy. Xcel Energy's Bay Front plant in Ashland, Wisconsin, is a three-unit generating station that has become a model for the creative use of fuels: coal, waste wood, railroad ties, discarded tires, natural gas, and petroleum coke. Two of the three Bay Front operating units already use biomass as their primary fuel. Xcel Energy recently proposed a plan to install biomass gasification technology at Bay Front. The waste-to-energy facilities use waste that would otherwise end up in landfills. The Wisconsin waste-to-energy plant burns wood waste in combination with refuse-derived fuel (RDF). Xcel Energy owns and operates two nuclear power plants, Monticello Nuclear Generating Plant near Monticello, Minnesota, and Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant near Red Wing, Minnesota and stores the spent fuel from these nuclear plants on site in independent spent fuel storage installations. (ISFSIs). Xcel Energy also offers customers incentives to install solar panels. At the end of 2011, more than 10,600 photovoltaic systems had been installed, with a capacity of about 121 megawatts (DC). In early 2011, Xcel Energy suspended the solar rebate program before reaching a settlement a month later with representatives of solar power companies to restore the solar incentive program until it is fully reviewed by the Public Utilities Commission. Xcel paid $80,000,000 in a settlement."

Xerox Corporation Type Public Traded&#160;as NYSE:&#160;XRX S&amp;P 500 Component Industry Document services Business process services Founded Rochester, New York, U.S. (1906; 110&#160;years ago&#160;(1906)) Founders Joseph C. Wilson Chester Carlson Headquarters Norwalk, Connecticut, U.S. Area served Worldwide Key people Ursula Burns (Chairman &amp; CEO) Products Office printers, Production printers &amp; digital presses, multi-function printers, wide format printers, projectors, scanners Copiers, and other office equipments Services business processes, document management, and outsourcing services Revenue US$ 18.04&#160;billion (2015) Operating income US$ 645&#160;million (2015) Net income US$ 488&#160;million (2015) Total assets US$ 24.80&#160;billion (2015) Total equity 9.43&#160;billion (2015) Number of employees 140,800 (2015) Xerox is headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut (moved from Stamford, Connecticut in October 2007), The company expanded substantially throughout the 1960s, making millionaires of some long-suffering investors who had nursed the company through the slow research and development phase of the product. In 1960, a xerography research facility called the Wilson Center for Research and Technology was opened in Webster, New York. In 1961, the company changed its name to Xerox Corporation. Xerox common stock (XRX) was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1961 and on the Chicago Stock Exchange in 1990. In 1963 Xerox introduced the Xerox 813, the first desktop plain-paper copier, realizing Carlson's vision of a copier that could fit on anyone's office desk. Ten years later in 1973, a basic, analogue, color copier, based on the 914, followed. The 914 itself was gradually sped up to become the 420 and 720. The 813 was similarly developed into the 330 and 660 products and, eventually, also the 740 desktop microfiche printer. Xerox's first foray into duplicating, as distinct from copying, was with the Xerox 2400, introduced in 1966. The model number denoted the number of prints produced in an hour. Although not as fast as offset printing, this machine introduced the industry's first automatic document feeder, paper slitter and perforator, and collator (sorter). This product was soon sped up by fifty percent to become the Xerox 3600 Duplicator. Meanwhile, a small lab team was borrowing 914 copiers and modifying them. The lab was developing what it called long distance xerography (LDX) to connect two copiers using the public telephone network, so that a document scanned on one machine would print out on the other. The LDX system was introduced in 1964. Many years later this work came to fruition in the Xerox telecopiers, seminal to today's fax machines. The fax operation in today's multifunction copiers is true to Carlson's original vision for these devices. In 1968, C. Peter McColough, a longtime executive of Haloid and Xerox, became Xerox's CEO. The same year, the company consolidated its headquarters at Xerox Square in downtown Rochester, New York, with its 30-story Xerox Tower. Xerox embarked on a series of acquisitions. It purchased University Microfilms International in 1962, Electro-Optical Systems in 1963, and R.R. Bowker in 1967. In 1969, Xerox acquired Scientific Data Systems (SDS), which it renamed the Xerox Data Systems (XDS) division and which produced the Sigma line and its successor XDS 5xx series of mainframe computers in the 1960s and 1970s. Xeros sold XDS was to Honeywell in 1975. Xerox Tower in Rochester, New York served as headquarters in 1968–1969 Stamford, Connecticut served as headquarters from 1969 to 2007 Former manufacturing facility in Henrietta, New York, constructed in the 1960s and sold to Harris RF Communications in 2010. Xerox Canada Head Office at North American Life Centre (Xerox Tower), North York, Ontario 1970s In the mid-1970s, Xerox introduced the ""Xerox 9200 Duplicating System"". Originally designed to be sold to print shops, to increase their productivity, it was twice a fast as the 3600 duplicator at two impressions per second (7200 per hour). It was followed by the 9400, which did auto-duplexing, and then by the 9500, which was which added variable zoom reduction and electronic lightness/darkness control. Following these years of record profits, in 1975, Xerox resolved an anti-trust suit with the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which at the time was under the direction of Frederic M. Scherer. The Xerox consent decree resulted in the forced licensing of the company's entire patent portfolio, mainly to Japanese competitors. Within four years of the consent decree, Xerox's share of the U.S. copier market dropped from nearly 100% to less than 14%. In 1979, Xerox purchased Western Union International (WUI) as the basis for its proposed Xerox Telecommunications Network (XTEN) for local-loop communications. However, after three years, in 1982, the company decided the idea was a mistake and sold its assets to MCI at a loss. In 1983 Xerox bought Crum &amp; Forster, an insurance company, and formed Xerox Financial Services (XFS) in 1984. NewField IT developed the Asset DB toolset which is widely used across the managed print services (MPS) market along with MPS market-leading consulting and software services delivering a large impact for this relatively small acquisition. based on the 3600 copier. It had an optical character generator designed by optical engineer Phil Chen. In 1977, following IBM's laser printer introduction, the Xerox 9700 was introduced. Laser printing eventually became a multibillion-dollar business for Xerox. In the late 1970s Xerox introduced the ""Xerox 350 color slide system"" This product allowed the customer to create digital word and graphic 35mm slides. Many of the concepts used in today's ""Photo Shop"" programs were pioneered with this technology. In 1980, Xerox announced the forward looking 5700 laser printing system, a much smaller version of their 9700, but with revolutionary touch screen capabilities and multiple media input (word processing disks, IBM magcards, etc.) and printer 'finishing' options. This product was allegedly never intended to make the commercial markets due to its development cost, but rather to show the innovation of Xerox. It did take off with many customers, but was soon replaced with its still smaller and lower cost 2700 Distributed Electronic Printer offering in 1982. Main article: Xerox PARC The Xerox Alto workstation was developed at Xerox PARC. In 1970, under company president C. Peter McColough, Xerox opened the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, known as Xerox PARC. The facility developed many modern computing technologies such as the graphical user interface (GUI), laser printing, WYSIWYG text editors and Ethernet. From these inventions, Xerox PARC created the Xerox Alto in 1973, a small minicomputer similar to a modern workstation or personal computer. This machine can be considered the first true Personal Computer, given its versatile combination of a cathode-ray-type screen, mouse-type pointing device, and a QWERTY-type alphanumeric keyboard. But the Alto was never commercially sold, as Xerox itself could not see the sales potential of it. It was, however, installed in Xerox's own offices, worldwide and those of the US Government and military, who could see the potential. Within these sites the individual workstations were connected together by Xerox's own unique LAN, The Ethernet. Data was sent around this system of heavy, yellow, low loss coaxial cable using the packet data system. In addition, PARC also developed one of the earliest internetworking protocol suites, the PARC Universal Packet (PUP). In 1979, Steve Jobs made a deal with Xerox's venture capital division: He would let them invest $1 million in exchange for a look at the technology they were working on. Jobs and the others saw the commercial potential of the WIMP (Window, Icon, Menu, and Pointing device) system and redirected development of the Apple Lisa to incorporate these technologies. Jobs is quoted as saying, ""They just had no idea what they had."" In 1980, Jobs invited several key PARC researchers to join his company so that they could fully develop and implement their ideas. In 1981, Xerox released a system similar to the Alto, the Xerox 8010 Star. It was the first commercial system to incorporate technologies that have subsequently become commonplace in personal computers, such as a bitmapped display, window-based GUI, mouse, Ethernet networking, file servers, print servers and e-mail. The Xerox 6085 Star, despite its technological breakthroughs, did not sell well due to its high price, costing $16,000 per unit. A typical Xerox Star-based office, complete with network and printers, would have cost $100,000. In the mid-1980s, Apple considered buying Xerox; however, a deal was never reached. After Kriesel provided evidence that the error was also occurring in all three image quality modes (normal, higher and high) including the factory defaults, Xerox corrected their statement and released a software patch to eliminate the problem. The word ""xerox"" is used as a synonym for ""photocopy"" (both as a noun and a verb) in many areas; for example,""I xeroxed the document and placed it on your desk."" or ""Please make a xeroxed copy of the articles and hand them out a week before the exam"". Though both are common, the company does not condone such uses of its trademark, and is particularly concerned about the ongoing use of Xerox as a verb as this places the trademark in danger of being declared a generic word by the courts. The company is engaged in an ongoing advertising and media campaign to convince the public that Xerox should not be used as a verb. Despite their efforts, many dictionaries continue to include the use of ""xerox"" as a verb, including the Oxford English Dictionary. In 2012, the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) of India declared ""xerox"" a non-generic term after ""almost 50 years (1963–2009) of continued existence on the register without challenge, and with proof of almost 44 years of use evident (1965-2009)"","

(/ˈzaɪlɪŋks/ ZY-lingks) is an American technology company, primarily a supplier of programmable logic devices. It is known for inventing the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and as the first semiconductor company with a fabless manufacturing model. Major FPGA product families include Virtex (high-performance), Kintex (mid-range) and Artix (low-cost), and the retired Spartan (low-cost) series. Major computer software includes Xilinx ISE and Vivado Design Suite. By late 1987 the company had raised more than $18 million in venture capital (worth approximately $37 million in 2016 dollars adjusted for inflation) and generated revenues at an annualized rate of nearly $14 million. During this time period, the company which had been providing funding to Xilinx, Monolithic Memories Inc. (MMI), was purchased by Xilinx competitor AMD. The company also moved to a 144,000-square-foot (13,400&#160;m2) plant in San Jose, California in order to keep pace with demand from companies like HP, Apple Inc., IBM and Sun Microsystems who were buying large quantities from Xilinx. These targeted design platforms are an alternative to costly application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and application-specific standard products (ASSPs). The company has expanded its product portfolio since its founding. Xilinx sells a broad range of FPGAs, complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs), design tools, intellectual property and reference designs. In addition to Zynq-7000, Xilinx product lines (see Current Family Lines) include the Virtex, Kintex and Artix series, each including configurations and models optimized for different applications. The Spartan-3 platform was the industry’s first 90nm FPGA, delivering more functionality and bandwidth per dollar than was previously possible, setting new standards in the programmable logic industry. Xilinx designs, develops and markets programmable logic products, including integrated circuits (ICs), software design tools, predefined system functions delivered as intellectual property (IP) cores, design services, customer training, field engineering and technical support. Xilinx's FPGAs have been used for the ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment) at the CERN European laboratory on the French-Swiss border to map and disentangle the trajectories of thousands of subatomic particles. The Virtex-II Pro, Virtex-4, Virtex-5, and Virtex-6 FPGA families, which include up to two embedded IBM PowerPC cores, are targeted to the needs of system-on-chip (SoC) designers. Xilinx FPGAs can run a regular embedded OS (such as Linux or vxWorks) and can implement processor peripherals in programmable logic. Xilinx's IP cores include IP for simple functions (BCD encoders, counters, etc.), for domain specific cores (digital signal processing, FFT and FIR cores) to complex systems (multi-gigabit networking cores, the MicroBlaze soft microprocessor and the compact Picoblaze microcontroller). Xilinx also creates custom cores for a fee. The main design toolkit Xilinx provides engineers is the Vivado Design Suite, an integrated design environment (IDE) with a system-to-IC level tools built on a shared scalable data model and a common debug environment. Vivado includes electronic system level (ESL) design tools for synthesizing and verifying C-based algorithmic IP; standards based packaging of both algorithmic and RTL IP for reuse; standards based IP stitching and systems integration of all types of system building blocks; and the verification of blocks and systems. Xilinx's Embedded Developer's Kit (EDK) supports the embedded PowerPC 405 and 440 cores (in Virtex-II Pro and some Virtex-4 and -5 chips) and the Microblaze core. Xilinx's System Generator for DSP implements DSP designs on Xilinx FPGAs. A freeware version of its EDA software called ISE WebPACK is used with some of its non-high-performance chips. Xilinx is the only (as of 2007) FPGA vendor to distribute a native Linux freeware synthesis toolchain. The company’s stacked silicon interconnect (SSI) technology stacks several (three or four) active FPGA dies side-by-side on a silicon interposer&#160;– a single piece of silicon that carries passive interconnect. The individual FPGA dies are conventional, and are flip-chip mounted by microbumps on to the interposer. The interposer provides direct interconnect between the FPGA dies, with no need for transceiver technologies such as high-speed SERDES. Vivado provides faster integration and implementation for programmable systems into devices with 3D stacked silicon interconnect technology, ARM processing systems, analog mixed signal (AMS), and many semiconductor intellectual property (IP) cores. In newer FPGA products, Xilinx minimizes total power consumption by the adoption of a high-K metal gate (HKMG) process, which allows for low static power consumption. At the 28&#160;nm node, static power is a significant portion of the total power dissipation of a device and in some cases is the dominant factor. Through the use of a HKMG process, Xilinx has reduced power use while increasing logic capacity. Main article: Virtex (FPGA) The Virtex series of FPGAs have integrated features that include FIFO and ECC logic, DSP blocks, PCI-Express controllers, Ethernet MAC blocks, and high-speed transceivers. In addition to FPGA logic, the Virtex series includes embedded fixed function hardware for commonly used functions such as multipliers, memories, serial transceivers and microprocessor cores. In 2011, Xilinx began shipping sample quantities of the Virtex-7 2000T ""3D FPGA"", which combines four smaller FPGAs into a single package by placing them on a special silicon interconnection pad (called an interposer) to deliver 6.8 billion transistors in a single large chip. The interposer provides 10,000 data pathways between the individual FPGAs&#160;– roughly 10 to 100 times more than would usually be available on a board&#160;– to create a single FPGA. Legacy Virtex devices (Virtex, Virtex-II, Virtex-II Pro, Virtex 4) are still available, but are not recommended for use in new designs. Kintex The Kintex-7 family is the first Xilinx mid-range FPGA family that the company claims delivers Virtex-6 family performance at less than half the price while consuming 50 percent less power. The Kintex family includes high-performance 12.5 Gbit/s or lower-cost optimized 6.5 Gbit/s serial connectivity, memory, and logic performance required for applications such as high volume 10G optical wired communication equipment, and provides a balance of signal processing performance, power consumption and cost to support the deployment of Long Term Evolution (LTE) wireless networks. For software developers, Zynq-7000 appear the same as a standard, fully featured ARM processor-based system-on-chip (SOC), booting immediately at power-up and capable of running a variety of operating systems independently of the programmable logic. In 2013, Xilinx introduced the Zynq-7100, which integrates digital signal processing (DSP) to meet emerging programmable systems integration requirements of wireless, broadcast, medical and military applications. Another explanation has it that two of the founders, Ross Freeman and Jim Barnett both attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, also called the Fighting Illini. The name allegedly originated because the company founders were two ex-Illini, hence Xilinx (two 'X' Illini). Ross Freeman Altera is Xilinx's strongest competitor with 34% of the market. Other key players in this market are Actel (now Microsemi) and Lattice Semiconductor. ^ a b c d e f g h i j ""XILINX INC 2014 Annual Report Form (10-K)"" (XBRL).

Acquisitions Their oxygen meter had used the technique of polarography, and they developed further products on the same principle, including t the first immobilized-enzyme-activated polarographic sensor in 1972. They then developed further biomedical instrumentation: the first commercially successful whole blood glucose analyzer in 1975, the first commercial alcohol measurement instrument using immobilized enzyme electrode technology in 1982. They continued using immobilized enzyme techniques, for the first direct whole-blood L-lactate assays using immobilized enzyme electrode also in 1982. . They also continued developing thermal technology, with the first commercial gallium melting-point temperature standard (29.7715°C) in 1977 and the first robotic-manufactured glass-encapsulated precision thermistors in 1996. They produced their first environmental monitoring instrument, a dissolved oxygen sensor, in 1992. They then developed instrumentation for conductivity measurement of ultrapure water in 1996, and the first accurate commercial fiber-optic based CO2 measurement system, in 1998. Beginning in the late 1990s, they began producing analytical software and integrated analytical instrumentation: BOD Analyst(TM), software that automates BOD testing.They also began developing integrated analytical systems: the YSI 600 QS Quick Sample multiparameter spot sampling system, the YSI 5200 Recirculating System Monitor, and the YSI 7100 Multiparameter Bioanalytical System (MBS).
